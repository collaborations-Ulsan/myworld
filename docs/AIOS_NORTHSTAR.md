# AIOS North Star

## RE-SCOPE — 2026-08-01 (founder GO; supersedes the compounding framing below)

**AIOS is an enforced-sovereignty, externally-verified execution substrate with a
tamper-evident record.** It verifies and constrains intelligence; it does not manufacture it.
This identity is what the evidence supports after the pre-registered three-transport null
(θ weights / X context / E runtime — `docs/AIOS_THREE_CHANNEL_NULL_REPORT_2026-08-01.md`):
on a frozen model, OS-side accumulated experience did not compound first-attempt autonomous
performance under external oracles, and the Mortuary Clause bars relitigating that thesis.

What AIOS therefore IS (each earned on its own evidence): kernel-enforced sandboxing with an
inviolable privacy boundary; external-oracle verification gates (skills register only through
sandbox+unit-test; execution closes only with receipts); an append-only, Merkle-rooted,
pre-registration-disciplined record. The memory/capability/genesis organs remain as
*bookkeeping and routing* for that substrate — their value claim is provenance and control,
NOT model improvement. Intelligence-layer claims (world models, drive, distillation) belong to
the model layer and must earn separate pre-registered evidence.

The sections below predate the re-scope and are retained for the organ/role map and the
task flow; read their "memory makes agents better" framing as historical.

---

AIOS is a local-first **memory layer for AI agents**: it keeps a behavioral-memory
ledger across runs and models so your agents carry forward what worked instead of
starting each session from zero. Concretely, it turns a user goal into planned work,
retrieved context, selected capabilities, verified execution, and durable memory —
all local-first, through the provider CLIs you already use.

See `AIOS_DEFINITION.md` for the strict definition and anti-cheat invariants.

The target user experience is:

```text
User gives a goal.
AIOS plans, retrieves, routes, executes, verifies, remembers, and reports.
User reads logs and makes checkpoint decisions.
```

The user should not need to think in directories, apps, provider CLIs, MCP
servers, API surfaces, or skill names. Those remain implementation details
behind the AIOS control plane.

## Three OS Roles

```text
Hive Mind
= executor, scheduler, verifier, provider harness

MemoryOS
= local-first memory graph, context pager, provenance ledger, review lifecycle

CapabilityOS
= capability map, router, binding planner, fallback recommender
```

When a task arrives:

1. Hive Mind decides how to do the work: decomposition, agent roles, scheduler,
   verification gates, receipts, and operator checkpoints.
2. MemoryOS decides what knowledge to bring: accepted memory, project state,
   prior decisions, constraints, related work, production examples, and
   evidence-linked context packs.
3. CapabilityOS decides what can help: provider CLIs, local models, MCP servers,
   APIs, skills, scripts, browser tools, external services, and fallback routes.
4. Hive Mind executes through the harness.
5. MemoryOS records receipts, drafts, retrieval traces, and review outcomes.
6. CapabilityOS records capability observations so future routing improves.

## Embracing Layer (2026-06-23, founder directive)

AIOS does not compete with peer agent systems — it is the operating layer that
**wraps them all as substrates**. The same way the head already wraps provider
CLIs (`aios_adapters.py`), local models (`aios_substrate_router.py`), and domain
tools (`domain.run`), peer systems plug in as coordinated substrates under one
authority/memory/provenance kernel. Convergence with these systems is demand
validation, not a threat: sameness is fine, the moat is ownership — *this user's*
compounding organism, which no peer can scoop (1-person-1-AIOS).

| Peer system | What it is | AIOS slot it plugs into |
|---|---|---|
| NousResearch/hermes-agent | local head coordinating provider CLIs | reference impl of `aios_head` |
| omc / omx | Claude/Codex workflow + sub-agent delegation | workflow layer above the turn-loop |
| Q00/ouroboros ("Agent OS") | policy-bound replayable execution contract | a routable executor substrate |
| August-murr / razzant ouroboros | self-evolving loop | dream-cycle / round-controller (with named-exit safety the runaway lacked) |
| agiresearch/AIOS | agent-execution kernel + SDK | a Hive execution substrate |

The embracing mechanism already exists (adapters + substrate router + domain.run);
making a specific peer system *callable* is one adapter each, added when that
system is present locally — not built speculatively.

## Final Shape

```text
Prompt in.
Work plan from Hive Mind.
Context from MemoryOS.
Capability plan from CapabilityOS.
Execution through Hive Mind.
Evidence and memory back into MemoryOS.
Capability observations back into CapabilityOS.
Operator checkpoints when the contract is uncertain.
```

This is not a monolithic app. It is a contract-bound ecosystem where each OS has
its own ledger and agent loop, but shares one user goal. `myworld/` acts as the
control tower: it does not do every task itself, but coordinates the systems
that do.

## Readiness Bar

AIOS is not ready merely because the docs describe it. The north star is ready
only when one cross-OS task is repeatable without chat context:

```text
goal
  -> contract
  -> dispatch to owning repo
  -> MemoryOS context/provenance
  -> CapabilityOS route/observation
  -> Hive Mind or repo-local execution
  -> verification evidence
  -> durable closeout in the AIOS ledger
```

Until that loop is repeatable, agents should report a concrete level:
`described`, `contractable`, `dispatchable`, `executable`, `verifiable`,
`learnable`, or `repeatable`.
