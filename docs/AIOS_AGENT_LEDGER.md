# AIOS Agent Ledger

This is the shared append-only log for the MyWorld AIOS ecosystem. Use it for
cross-repo decisions, OS-boundary changes, and final-AIOS design records.

For repo-local implementation details, also update that repo's own worklog.

## 2026-07-25 16:58 KST — codex@myworld — aiosd architecture adversarial review

- repo: myworld
- role: research / architecture challenge
- goal: adversarially test the 2026-07-22 decision that AIOS should become one
  resident local daemon with thin CLI/MCP clients.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: local sources `docs/AIOS_FORM_FACTOR_DECISION_2026-07-22.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`, `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`; classifier receipt:
  `python scripts/aios_boundary_classifier.py --question "...one local daemon
  aiosd..." --json` returned `layer=execution_substrate`,
  `owner_repo=hivemind`, `authority=execute_with_receipt`; current public
  sources checked: MCP Authorization 2025-11-25, MCP Security Best Practices,
  Linux Landlock docs dated June 2026, systemd socket activation docs, Docker
  Engine daemon security docs, Linux unix(7), A2A project docs.
- decision: proposed verdict is `SURVIVES-WITH-CONDITIONS`, not confirmed.
  A resident all-authority daemon is premature and creates a local control
  socket attack surface; the minimum defensible shape is socket-activated or
  idle-exiting, file-canonical, unprivileged, least-authority, receipt-first,
  and unable to execute provider/tool work without per-request contract gates.
- risk: if `aiosd` holds live authoritative state separate from append-only
  files, AIOS gains cache-coherence bugs and an always-on compromise target
  before proving impossible-to-get capabilities.
- next: Hive should draft an experiment contract for a minimal
  socket-activated coordinator and prove at least one capability impossible
  with fast-start CLI plus file-backed MCP before promoting `aiosd` to kernel
  architecture.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-21 KST — codex@myworld — AIOS canonical shape disambiguation

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane semantics / completion vocabulary
- goal: remove ambiguity around whether AIOS is a kernel, product, service,
  control plane, public Akashic infra, or finished operating system.
- changed: added `docs/AIOS_CANONICAL_SHAPE.md`; updated
  `docs/AIOS_DEFINITION.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: `python3 scripts/aios_world_service_audit.py --json` reports
  `completion_claim_supported=true`, `counts={proven:14, partial:0, weak:0,
  missing:0}`; focused readiness tests passed 25/25; GenesisOS critique
  required tables, assumptions/negations, and time horizons.
- decision: AIOS claims must be scoped. Allowed status words include
  `kernel-complete`, `self-maintaining-complete`,
  `world-service-objective-ready`, `service-ready`, `world-deployable`,
  `public-infra-live`, and `public-product-ready`. Unqualified
  `AIOS complete` and `production-ready` are invalid.
- risk: this resolves vocabulary, not every product risk. Public Akashic and
  Cloudflare Pages evidence prove public infrastructure; public-product
  readiness still needs real-user validation and recovery/support proof.
- next: use `docs/AIOS_CANONICAL_SHAPE.md` as the vocabulary gate for README,
  deploy docs, release notes, contracts, and external claims.
- status: completed

## 2026-06-19 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0279 world-service objective audit

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / read-only completion audit
- goal: prevent green release gates from being mistaken for proof that the
  entire active AIOS world-service objective is complete.
- changed: added `scripts/aios_world_service_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_world_service_audit.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0279-world-service-objective-audit.md`, and updated
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: focused unittest, py_compile, JSON smoke, diff check, AIOS route,
  MemoryOS retrieve, GenesisOS challenge, and local helper.
- decision: the audit uses `proven`, `partial`, `weak`, and `missing` so
  proposed contracts such as ASC-0277/ASC-0278 cannot count as completed proof.
  It reinforces ASC-0270/ASC-0271: Codex owns dream/product expansion and
  objective measurement; Claude owns hardening result packets and child-repo
  implementation.
- risk: conservative evidence rows may need revision when child repos add
  stronger primitives; external hosted-scale proof still needs operator
  authority before any live deployment.
- next: run `python3 scripts/aios_world_service_audit.py --json` before any
  future goal-completion claim; prioritize ASC-0277, ASC-0278, CapabilityOS
  SkillOS migration, and hosted-scale proof gaps.
- status: closed

## 2026-06-19 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0278 OpenAI agent surface absorption proposed

- repo: myworld
- role: source-backed planning / contract drafting
- goal: bind current OpenAI agent-service surfaces to AIOS OS ownership before
  AIOS depends on provider-managed state, deprecated visual workflow products,
  or raw traces as memory.
- changed: added
  `docs/research/AIOS_OPENAI_AGENT_SURFACE_DELTA_2026-06-19.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0278-openai-agent-surface-absorption.md`, and updated
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: official OpenAI docs checked for Agents SDK, Agent Builder,
  ChatKit, running agents, results/state, Sandbox Agents, MCP/connectors,
  observability, evals, background mode, and conversation state; AIOS route,
  GenesisOS challenge, local helper, and read-only explorer were invoked.
- decision: AIOS should absorb stable primitives into Hivemind, MemoryOS,
  CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, and MyWorld contracts. Agent Builder is a transition
  surface, not canonical AIOS state.
- risk: provider state can split authority from MemoryOS; raw traces or MCP
  payloads can leak private data; background mode has retention/ZDR semantics;
  Agent Builder and the legacy Evals platform have shutdown timelines; child
  repo implementation must not start from MyWorld under this proposal.
- next: accept ASC-0278 for Claude hardening; Claude should return an
  `aios.os_absorption_split.v1` packet and owner-specific follow-on contracts.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-16 KST — codex@dacon — ASC-0277 CLI log asset pool ledger proposed

- repo: myworld
- role: planner / contract drafting
- goal: report a founder/product idea to the AIOS development team: make
  MemoryOS able to turn provider/agent CLI logs into privacy-safe,
  hash-addressed, reviewable assets that an AIOS user pool can verify without
  raw logs.
- changed: added
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0277-memoryos-cli-log-asset-pool-ledger.md`.
- evidence: local MemoryOS inspection found existing primitives
  (`import-run`, `hive-live validate/import/graph`, `SourceArtifact`,
  draft `MemoryObject`, retrieval/provenance traces, provider-doc
  assetization) but no completed general-purpose `cli-log assetize` surface for
  arbitrary provider CLI logs and pool-verifiable receipt packets.
- decision: propose this as a MemoryOS-owned contract with Hive receipt
  support, CapabilityOS route/risk support, and MyWorld pool-governance policy.
- risk: raw provider logs may contain secrets, private prompts, unpublished
  competition strategy/code, account data, or local paths. Pool sharing must be
  hash/summary-first, draft-first, and review-gated; token/reputation semantics
  require separate governance/legal review.
- next: MemoryOS dev team should implement a synthetic-fixture `cli-log`
  validate/assetize/import flow, then Hive adds provider wrapper event parity.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-12 23:50 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0235 world deployment readiness gate

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / readiness hardening
- goal: prevent local `AIOS COMPLETE` from being overclaimed as hosted,
  world-deployable agent-service readiness.
- changed: added `docs/contracts/ASC-0234-world-deployable-aios-readiness-spine.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0235-world-deployment-readiness-cli.md`,
  `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`, and
  `tests/test_aios_world_readiness.py`.
- evidence: traced Claude's five local commits through current git history;
  verified `aios_provider.py status` reports Gemini and local Ollama available
  while Claude API lacks a key; `aios_completion.py --json` reports local
  self-maintaining completion; `python3 -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_world_readiness -v` passed 4/4; `python3 -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_world_readiness.py` passed; `python3
  scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` reports
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false`, `met_count=1`, `partial_count=6`,
  `missing_count=0`; `git diff --check` passed before ledger closeout.
- decision: world deployment readiness is now a separate machine-readable axis
  with schema `aios.world_readiness.v1`; local completion remains valid only
  for local self-maintenance.
- risk: readiness markers are intentionally conservative path-based evidence;
  owner repos still need dedicated implementation contracts for runtime
  isolation, Akashic trace graph, SkillOS registry, credential broker, and SECI
  entropy enforcement.
- next: create `ASC-0237` for MemoryOS Akashic work-lineage and replay
  checkpoint index, then dispatch owner-specific packets rather than editing
  child repo internals from MyWorld.
- status: done

## 2026-06-12 23:58 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0237 Akashic lineage contract proposed

- repo: myworld
- role: contract drafting / owner handoff
- goal: turn the world-readiness `durable_work_lineage` and
  `akashic_observability` partial axes into a MemoryOS-owned work contract.
- changed: added
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0237-memoryos-akashic-work-lineage-replay-index.md`.
- evidence: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` reports
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false` with those axes still partial; existing
  local pieces include `scripts/aios_work.py`, `scripts/aios_checkpoint.py`,
  `scripts/aios_ingest_session.py`, and MemoryOS retrieval trace surfaces.
- decision: keep the implementation in MemoryOS and require reference/hash/
  status metadata instead of raw private provider transcripts or credentials.
- risk: contract is proposed only; no MemoryOS packet has been dispatched and
  no child repo implementation has been changed from MyWorld.
- next: accept and dispatch ASC-0237 to MemoryOS, or create ASC-0236 first if
  runtime isolation/credential boundary is the preferred next bottleneck.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-13 00:14 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0236 credential broker boundary

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / privacy boundary hardening
- goal: reduce repeated provider credential prompts by adding a broker that
  writes request receipts without printing credential values.
- changed: added `docs/contracts/ASC-0236-credential-broker-boundary.md`,
  `scripts/aios_credential_broker.py`, and
  `tests/test_aios_credential_broker.py`.
- evidence: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_credential_broker
  tests.test_aios_world_readiness tests.test_aios_secret_scan -v` passed
  15/15; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/aios_credential_broker.py
  scripts/aios_world_readiness.py scripts/aios_vault.py` passed;
  `python3 scripts/aios_credential_broker.py --json request
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --provider claude --purpose 'multi-provider synthesis'`
  returned a redacted request with `allowed_to_print_value=false` and
  `chat_secret_request_allowed=false`; `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json`
  now reports `credential_private_data_boundary=status=met`, while overall
  world readiness remains false with `met_count=2`, `partial_count=5`.
- decision: credential availability is now reportable as
  `available_via_env`, `vault_may_hold_value`, or `missing` without decrypting
  the vault during status probes or exposing values in chat/docs/receipts.
- risk: provider wrappers do not yet consume broker receipts automatically;
  this contract closes the broker surface, not every provider integration.
- next: continue ASC-0237 for MemoryOS Akashic work-lineage/replay, then
  create the Hive runtime isolation contract for hosted execution receipts.
- status: done

## 2026-06-13 00:26 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0238 SkillOS registry

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / capability routing hardening
- goal: add a recommendation-only SkillOS registry so AIOS can map skills,
  provider surfaces, owners, risks, evidence, and fallbacks without granting
  execution authority.
- changed: added `docs/contracts/ASC-0238-skillos-recommendation-registry.md`,
  `scripts/aios_skillos_registry.py`, and
  `tests/test_aios_skillos_registry.py`.
- evidence: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_skillos_registry
  tests.test_aios_world_readiness -v` passed 7/7;
  `python3 scripts/aios_skillos_registry.py --json list` returned
  `recommendation_only=true` and `execution_enabled=false`;
  `python3 scripts/aios_skillos_registry.py --json recommend --task 'need
  credential vault privacy broker for provider' --limit 2` ranked
  `skill_credential_broker` first; `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json`
  now reports `skillos_routing=status=met`, with overall
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false`, `met_count=3`, `partial_count=4`.
- decision: SkillOS is a neuromuscular routing map, not an executor. Execution
  still requires Hive/owner-repo contract receipts.
- risk: this is a MyWorld projection over existing local surfaces. CapabilityOS
  should later own the deeper dynamic registry and observation feedback loop.
- next: continue ASC-0237 for MemoryOS Akashic lineage/replay and then Hive
  hosted runtime isolation; world readiness still has 4 partial axes.
- status: done

## 2026-06-13 00:38 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0239 SECI entropy gate

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / Genesis closeout hardening
- goal: prevent safe consensus closeouts by requiring SECI knowledge
  conversion, discomfort, and a counter-branch before synthesis is treated as
  closeout-ready.
- changed: added
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0239-genesis-seci-entropy-closeout-gate.md`,
  `scripts/aios_seci_entropy.py`, and `tests/test_aios_seci_entropy.py`.
- evidence: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_seci_entropy
  tests.test_aios_world_readiness -v` passed 7/7; `python3
  scripts/aios_seci_entropy.py --text 'Socialization shared experience.
  Externalization tacit to explicit. Combination synthesis. Internalization
  habit. Discomfort deficit. Counter-branch alternative assumption mutation.'
  --json` returned `pass=true`, `authority=advisory_only`, and
  `execution_enabled=false`; `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` now
  reports `genesis_seci_entropy=status=met`, with overall
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false`, `met_count=4`, `partial_count=3`.
- decision: SECI/entropy is an advisory closeout gate, not a GenesisOS
  execution surface and not final truth selection.
- risk: current marker detection is heuristic and should later be backed by
  GenesisOS branches and MemoryOS evidence refs for high-stakes closeouts.
- next: dispatch ASC-0237 to MemoryOS and ASC-0240 to Hive; remaining world
  readiness partial axes are durable lineage, Akashic observability, and hosted
  runtime isolation.
- status: done

## 2026-06-13 00:42 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0240 Hive runtime isolation contract proposed

- repo: myworld
- role: contract drafting / owner handoff
- goal: turn the world-readiness `cloud_execution_isolation` partial axis into
  a Hive-owned hosted runtime receipt contract.
- changed: added
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0240-hive-hosted-runtime-isolation-receipts.md`.
- evidence: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` reports
  `cloud_execution_isolation=status=partial`; existing evidence is local
  sandbox policy only (`scripts/aios_sandbox.py`, `tests/test_aios_sandbox.py`).
- decision: hosted runtime isolation belongs to Hive execution substrate; MyWorld
  should verify returned receipts rather than implement Hive internals here.
- risk: contract is proposed only; no Hive packet has been dispatched and no
  child repo implementation has been changed from MyWorld.
- next: accept and dispatch ASC-0240 to Hive, or continue ASC-0237 first if
  MemoryOS lineage is the preferred next bottleneck.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-12 22:55 KST — codex@myworld — OMO plugin removal

- repo: myworld + local Codex profile
- role: operator cleanup / capability deactivation
- goal: remove installed `oh-my-opencode` / `oh-my-openagent` / OMO plugin
  artifacts after the operator reported excessive Codex token pressure.
- changed: removed OMO source clones under `myworld/oh-my-openagent`,
  `myworld/omo`, and `uri/apps/oh-my-openagent`; removed Codex OMO plugin
  cache/data, temporary marketplace payloads, OMO/lazycodex npm and Bun caches,
  generated OMO bin wrappers, and OMO-generated Codex agent registrations;
  removed `omo@sisyphuslabs` marketplace/plugin/hook and generated agent
  blocks from `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/config.toml.aios-bak`.
- evidence: `tomllib` parsed both Codex config files successfully; `rg` found
  no remaining OMO plugin/config references in Codex config/plugin/bin
  surfaces; `find` found no remaining targeted OMO install paths; `command -v`
  returned no `omo`, `oh-my-openagent`, `lazycodex`, or `lazycodex-ai`
  executable; related OMO/lazycodex processes were terminated.
- decision: general Codex session logs, user memories, and unrelated
  same-named project code were not deleted; only confirmed plugin/source/cache
  artifacts were removed.
- risk: this active Codex session may still show previously injected OMO skills
  until a new session starts, but the next session should not load the removed
  plugin.
- next: none — operator checkpoint requested before any reinstall or
  replacement capability.
- status: done

## 2026-06-07 01:54 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0233 provider output disagreements

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: autonomous implementation / Hive verifier hardening
- goal: close Hive Product P0 #6 by extracting structured disagreement records
  from executed provider outputs, not only debate round previews.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0233-...p0-6.md`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/provider_disagreements.py`, thin Hive CLI glue,
  focused tests, and Hive product/worklog docs.
- evidence: CapabilityOS recommended `cap_hivemind_execution_harness`
  recommendation-only; subagent review confirmed the missing producer for
  debate-outside provider output disagreements; red tests caught missing CLI
  registration, ignored partial provider outputs, and missing stdout fallback.
  Focused Hive tests passed 4/4; wider provider/projection/inspection/
  validation suite passed 71/71; py_compile and `git diff --check` passed;
  Hive public release gate passed 19/19 with artifact root
  `.hivemind/release/20260607_015539`.
- decision: `provider-disagreements` writes a privacy-safe
  `provider_output_disagreements.json` report and merges structured records
  into `disagreements.json`; raw provider bodies are read only for internal
  comparison and are not included in reports.
- risk: Current disagreement axes are heuristic labels reused from Hive debate;
  future semantic comparison should require verifier-backed evidence before
  raising authority.
- next: commit/push ASC-0233, then continue to Product P0 #7.
- status: done

## 2026-06-07 01:52 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0232 route-quality fallback validation

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: autonomous implementation / Hive verifier hardening
- goal: close Hive Product P0 #5 by making route-quality scoring
  schema-validated and provider fallback explicit without granting fallback
  execution authority.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0232-...p0-5.md`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/route_quality.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/run_routing_quality_validation.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/provider_failure.py`, focused Hive glue/tests, and Hive
  product/worklog docs.
- evidence: CapabilityOS recommended `cap_aios_route_planner`
  recommendation-only; red tests caught missing fallback projection, malformed
  `routing_quality.json` validation, and Korean Codex failure classification;
  focused Hive tests passed 35/35; wider route/validation/provider/DAG suite
  passed 201/201; py_compile and `git diff --check` passed; Hive public
  release gate passed 19/19 with artifact root `.hivemind/release/20260607_013750`.
- decision: route-quality fallback is a prepare-only verifier signal. Localized
  Codex `틀렸습니다` / `접근 거부` maps to `pin_required_noninteractive`, not
  generic unknown failure.
- risk: fallback output quality still requires independent verifier receipts
  before final acceptance; ASC-0232 does not execute fallback providers.
- next: commit/push ASC-0232, then continue to Product P0 #6.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 20:10 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0227 autodraft boundary gate

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / autonomous contract drafting hardening
- goal: make goal-evolution contract drafts include substrate/surface/knowledge
  boundary evidence by default.
- changed: `scripts/aios_contract_autodraft.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_contract_autodraft.py`, `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0227-autodraft-boundary-gate.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_contract_autodraft
  tests.test_aios_boundary_classifier -v` passed 10/10 after a red test
  confirmed the missing boundary gate and later caught the ownership mismatch.
  `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_contract_autodraft.py scripts/aios_boundary_classifier.py`
  passed. `scripts/aios_contract_autodraft.py` remains 250 pure LOC.
- decision: autodrafted contracts now render `## Substrate / Surface /
  Knowledge Gate` using `aios.boundary_classifier.v1`, while remaining
  proposed-only and non-dispatched.
- risk: classifier quality is still rule-based; accepted contracts must still
  be reviewed by operator/policy gates before dispatch.
- next: run contract autodraft for the next goal-evolution recommendation and
  review the boundary gate before acceptance.
- status: closed

## 2026-06-05 20:06 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0226 boundary classifier CLI

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation / control-plane classifier
- goal: turn the ASC-0225 substrate/surface/knowledge boundary into a
  machine-readable CLI for future autonomous contract drafting.
- changed: `scripts/aios_boundary_classifier.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_boundary_classifier.py`, `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0226-boundary-classifier-cli.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_boundary_classifier -v`
  passed 7/7 after a red run that failed because the script did not exist.
  Live smoke returned `layer=execution_substrate`, `owner_repo=hivemind`,
  and `authority=execute_with_receipt` for local LLM daemonization. Kepler
  subagent review supplied additional edge cases; multi-model review now
  remains `authority=recommendation_only`.
- decision: unknown prompts classify as `contract_clarification` instead of
  execution. Multi-model/all-knowledge requests expand `knowledge_scope` but
  do not expand authority.
- risk: classifier is rule-based and conservative; it should guide contract
  drafting, not replace operator acceptance or Hive verification.
- next: call `scripts/aios_boundary_classifier.py --json` before the next
  autonomous implementation contract.
- status: closed

## 2026-06-05 19:54 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0225 substrate boundary classifier

- repo: myworld
- role: architecture / contract boundary proposal
- goal: answer whether AIOS should touch process/OS substrate, use
  agent-friendly plugins/contracts, or pull broad external knowledge before
  autonomous work expands scope.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0225-substrate-boundary-classifier.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_SMART_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`, `docs/AIOS_PRODUCTION_PRAXIS.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: local docs reviewed; external architecture evidence checked from
  MCP architecture and OpenAI Agents SDK guardrail/tracing docs; Volta subagent
  review returned the same recommendation to default to plugin/contract
  surfaces, reserve process/OS substrate for runtime guarantees, and treat
  broad external knowledge as cited context/evidence rather than execution
  authority.
- decision: AIOS should own a narrow kernel for authority, lifecycle,
  isolation, receipt integrity, rollback, and privacy. Most capabilities should
  enter through CapabilityOS/plugin/contract surfaces. External knowledge
  should enter as evidence, context packs, memory drafts, or Genesis challenge
  notes, then change contracts before execution.
- risk: proposed classifier is docs/policy only until a follow-up command or
  dispatch gate enforces the fields mechanically.
- next: accept `ASC-0225` or create a follow-up implementation contract for a
  machine-readable boundary classifier.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-05 02:12 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0224 cleanup contract materialized

- when: 2026-06-05 02:12 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: contract materialization / delegated operator
- goal: turn the monitor cleanup promotion into a durable proposed ASC without
  dispatching or mutating MemoryOS.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0224-resolve-memoryos-monitor-dirty-state-through-owner-reviewed-provenance-cleanup.md`,
  regenerated `apps/control/aios-control-snapshot.json`,
  `apps/control/aios-control-data.js`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this
  ledger.
- decision: materialized `.aios/promotions/monitor-cleanup-e862eae86110` into
  `ASC-0224` as `status=proposed`. The contract is MemoryOS-owner scoped and
  explicitly forbids MyWorld rewriting accepted-memory state, touching
  credentials, leaking private/raw source data, or deleting dirty entries before
  a receipt.
- evidence: materialization receipt exists locally at
  `.aios/promotions/monitor-cleanup-e862eae86110/materialization.json`; Control
  Center snapshot shows the promotion materialized to `ASC-0224` and lists the
  contract as the latest proposed item. Monitor remains
  `attention 1 ?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md asc-0223`, as expected.
- boundary: `ASC-0224` was not accepted or dispatched. MemoryOS state remains
  untouched; execution still requires operator/owner acceptance.
- next: MemoryOS owner can accept and dispatch `ASC-0224` when ready.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 05:39 KST — codex@chat-dacon-aibias — leaderboard-first lane pivot

- when: 2026-06-05 05:39 KST
- repo: `/home/user/workspaces/jaewon/dacon/aibias` (owned by dacon child repo context)
- agent: codex@chat-dacon-aibias
- role: execution bootstrap / experiment iteration
- goal: pivot from "submission automation only" to leaderboard-maximizing modeling work.
- evidence/actions:
  - Rechecked data and discovered `/tmp/dacon236722_data/train/train.csv` initially
    contained only 1 labeled row (header + 1), while `/tmp/dacon236722_data/open.zip` holds
    full test (8,500 rows) and only 1 train image/row.
  - Extracted archive to `/tmp/dacon236722_full` and confirmed
    `test/test.csv` has 8,500 rows and 8,500 images; leaderboard scores of top
    teams are ~0.995+ while user-provided `test_submit_...` baseline was ~0.3408.
  - Attempted local baseline inference with Hugging Face stack:
    - installed `torch` (CPU first, then CUDA build), `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, `numpy`.
    - `transformers` originally upgraded to 5.10.2 required `torch.float8_e8m0fnu`, incompatible with
      torch 2.6.0 in this env.
    - downgraded to `transformers==4.55.0` to restore `flan-t5-small` loading on torch 2.6.0.
  - Attempted large-batch scoring with `flan-t5-small` generation via `/tmp/predict_flan.py`
    on prompt format `"Choose the best answer index (0/1/2)"`.
    - generation path was blocked on runtime because CUDA build reports
      `RTX 5090 (sm_120) not compatible with installed torch CUDA kernels`
      and `no kernel image is available for execution on the device`.
    - cross-encoder runs (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) also triggered the same
      CUDA kernel mismatch when torch attempted GPU execution.
  - Practical implication: this container cannot execute currently installed torch build
    on available 5090 GPU; CPU fallback is required unless torch build is updated to support sm_120
    or another inference provider/runtime is introduced.
- decision:
  - Not yet producing a finalized leaderboard submission from local VLM/T5 generation in this
    run due the above GPU runtime mismatch.
  - Next execution path is to either (a) keep CPU-only inference with strict speed-aware batching,
    or (b) route to a provider-backed inference path (Gemini/Claude/local toolchain) before more
    leaderboard attempts.
- next: preserve this run note as handoff evidence; if continuing, resume from
  `/tmp/predict_flan.py` and convert to deterministic CPU-batched inference or
  external provider judge mode.
- status: blocked / pivot required

## 2026-06-05 06:44 KST — codex@chat-dacon-aibias — leaderboard-first lane iteration log

- when: 2026-06-05 06:44 KST
- repo: `/home/user/workspaces/jaewon/dacon/aibias` (owned by dacon child repo context)
- agent: codex@chat-dacon-aibias
- role: execution bootstrap / inference loop
- goal: keep leaderboard work moving under CPU-only constraints and keep API evidence in ledger.
- reasoning:
  - The previous GPU path was blocked by the local torch build mismatch (`RTX 5090 (sm_120) unsupported by installed torch kernels`), so model choice had to remain CPU-safe.
  - `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` was kept as the primary ranker because it is lightweight and already working locally without GPU; adding an optional NLI branch improves control on close calls while not breaking baseline flow.
  - A fresh local baseline output was still generated because only that path can produce complete candidate scores until model serving changes.
- evidence/actions:
  - Verified `submission_236722_cross.csv` exists with 8,500 rows at
    `/home/user/workspaces/jaewon/dacon/aibias`.
  - Label distribution remained balanced (`0`: 2,834 / `1`: 2,817 / `2`: 2,849), matching prior local run expectations.
  - Re-checked token store and test data path:
    - `/home/user/.config/aibias/dacon/token` exists with restrictive mode.
    - `/tmp/dacon236722_full/test/test.csv` exists with 8,500 rows.
  - Top public board scrape still shows rank 1 around score `1.0`; no public entry for `leaderboard_system`.
  - `submit_236722.sh` remained unchanged; submissions continue to fail on API response gating:
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_200347.json`: `message=wrong`, `data=403`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_200433.json`: `message=wrong`, `data=4`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_200446.json`: `message=wrong`, `data=4`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_201507.json`: `message=ok`, `data=0.3408333333333333`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_202044.json`: `message=wrong`, `data=4`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_202356.json`: `message=ok`, `data=0.3408333333333333`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_202437.json`: `message=ok`, `data=0.3408333333333333`
    - `artifacts/dacon_submit_20260604_213903.json`: `message=wrong`, `data=403`
  - `predict_236722_crossencoder.py` now contains optional uncertainty-triggered NLI rerank arguments
    (`--use-nli-fallback`, `--nli-margin`), preserving the baseline behavior by default.
- decision:
  - No further model changes in this turn. The immediate blocker is submit authorization/path consistency, not ranking logic.
- next: verify the API token session with DACON (`leaderboard_system`) or rotate token, then retry submission; if API is stable, run the NLI fallback variant (`--use-nli-fallback`) on the same file and compare score deltas before deeper model experiments.
- status: blocked / auth

## 2026-06-05 02:08 KST — codex@myworld — monitor cleanup promotion

- when: 2026-06-05 02:08 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: Control Center promotion/API implementation
- goal: let a monitor friction radar dirty finding produce a reviewable
  cleanup contract seed without directly mutating child repo state.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, regenerated control snapshot data,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- decision: added `/api/promote_monitor_cleanup` and a `Propose Cleanup`
  control on friction radar cards with dirty entries or related dispatches. The
  API writes a promotion receipt and `contract_seed.md` under `.aios/promotions`
  with MemoryOS owner scope, dirty entries, related dispatch context, forbidden
  private/auth files, and stop conditions.
- evidence: focused local app/control snapshot tests passed 62/62; Python and
  JS syntax checks passed; `git diff --check` passed. Live smoke created
  `.aios/promotions/monitor-cleanup-e862eae86110/contract_seed.md` from the
  current `memoryOS` dirty finding.
- boundary: `.aios/promotions/...` is local ignored runtime state. No MemoryOS
  file was modified, committed, deleted, or pushed.
- next: operator or MemoryOS owner can materialize the promotion into an ASC
  when ready, then dispatch it to MemoryOS.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 02:03 KST — codex@myworld — friction radar cleanup action

- when: 2026-06-05 02:03 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: Control Center action surface implementation
- goal: turn the visible `memoryOS` dirty/provenance context into a bounded
  operator action without mutating the child repo.
- changed: `apps/control/app.js`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, regenerated
  control snapshot data, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- decision: friction radar cards with dirty entries or related dispatches now
  render a `Plan Cleanup` chat action. The prompt includes owner, need, dirty
  entries, related dispatch, contract, status, latest status, and reason, and
  explicitly asks for a MemoryOS-owner provenance cleanup contract/gates/stop
  conditions instead of direct child repo overwrite.
- evidence: `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed; focused local app tests
  passed 44/44; focused control snapshot tests passed 17/17; `git diff --check`
  passed. Live monitor/control snapshot still reports
  `memoryOS -> ["?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md"] -> asc-0223`.
- boundary: no MemoryOS files were edited, committed, deleted, or pushed.
- next: use the `Plan Cleanup` action to draft the MemoryOS-local provenance
  cleanup slice when the owner is ready.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 01:58 KST — codex@myworld — friction radar dirty entry visibility

- when: 2026-06-05 01:58 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: Control Center / monitor surface implementation
- goal: make repo-dirty friction radar cards show the exact dirty status
  entries alongside related dispatch context.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  regenerated `apps/control/aios-control-snapshot.json`,
  `apps/control/aios-control-data.js`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this
  ledger.
- decision: friction radar items now preserve monitor `alert.entries` as
  `alert_entries`, and the Control Center renders those entries as compact code
  rows before related dispatch context.
- evidence: focused snapshot tests passed 17/17; Python and JS syntax checks
  passed. Live generated snapshot reports
  `memoryOS -> ["?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md"] -> asc-0223`.
- boundary: this is operator visibility only. It does not modify, delete,
  commit, or suppress MemoryOS local work.
- next: MemoryOS provenance cleanup can be decided from one radar card without
  opening raw monitor JSON.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 01:52 KST — codex@myworld — friction radar dispatch context

- when: 2026-06-05 01:52 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: Control Center / monitor surface implementation
- goal: make the new `repo_dirty.related_dispatches` monitor evidence visible
  in the operator-facing Control Center instead of leaving it buried in raw
  monitor JSON.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  regenerated `apps/control/aios-control-snapshot.json`,
  `apps/control/aios-control-data.js`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this
  ledger.
- decision: friction radar items now carry `related_dispatches`, and the UI
  renders each linked dispatch with dispatch id, contract id, current contract
  status, latest dispatch status, and reason/timestamp.
- evidence: focused Control Center/local app tests passed 61/61; JS and Python
  syntax checks passed; `git diff --check` passed. Live snapshot now reports
  `memoryOS -> asc-0223 -> released` in `friction_radar.items`.
- boundary: this does not hide or reconcile the MemoryOS dirty alert. It only
  makes the existing MyWorld closeout evidence visible to operators.
- next: MemoryOS owner can act on the visible provenance-cleanup prompt without
  reading raw monitor JSON.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 01:46 KST — codex@myworld — monitor repo-dirty dispatch context

- when: 2026-06-05 01:46 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: monitor implementation / delegated operator
- goal: make repeated child-repo dirty alerts actionable without hiding them or
  mutating child repo work.
- changed: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- decision: `repo_dirty` alerts now include recent `related_dispatches` for
  the dirty repo. Dispatch rows preserve latest status/reason from status
  events so status-less helper events such as `memory_writeback` do not erase a
  prior `released` close reason.
- evidence: focused monitor tests passed 14/14. Live snapshot for `memoryOS`
  dirty state now links the alert to `asc-0223` / `ASC-0223` with
  `current_contract_status=closed`, `latest_status=released`, and the
  partial-close reason.
- boundary: the alert is not reconciled or suppressed. `memoryOS` remains
  dirty/ahead and owner-owned; MyWorld only improves observability.
- next: MemoryOS owner can use the attached dispatch context to decide whether
  `.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md` remains the source artifact or migrates to a
  checked-in provenance artifact.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 01:43 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0223 concurrent MemoryOS evidence

- when: 2026-06-05 01:43 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- contract: `docs/contracts/ASC-0223-memoryos-product-domain-seed-review.md`
- decision: close `ASC-0223` as partial-with-followup. The dispatched watcher
  result stayed `held` because of concurrent MemoryOS local work, but MemoryOS
  search independently proves the same URI seed is already review-accepted as
  `mem_0c66b6db9ac73100`.
- evidence: `python -m memoryos.cli --root . search "URI clean-room sourcing
  rule" --json` returned `mem_0c66b6db9ac73100` with `project=URI`,
  `base_status=draft`, `effective_status=accepted`, `reviewer=claude@myworld`,
  and pointer refs only. `drafts list --status all --project URI --json`
  returned the same object and `latest_review.action=approve`.
- boundary: MyWorld did not delete, rewrite, commit, or push MemoryOS local
  work. `memoryOS` remains `ahead 11` with
  `?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md`; provenance cleanup belongs to MemoryOS.
- next: route a MemoryOS-local cleanup/retrieval-regression slice only after
  the owner resolves whether the temp seed should remain as source artifact or
  be migrated.
- status: closed_partial_with_followup

## 2026-06-05 01:34 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0223 MemoryOS product-domain seed review

- when: 2026-06-05 01:34 KST
- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: planner / delegated operator
- goal: route the URI clean-room sourcing seed through MemoryOS draft-first
  review so product-domain retrieval stops returning null.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0223-memoryos-product-domain-seed-review.md`,
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/asc-0223.memoryOS.json`,
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0223.memoryOS.result.json`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `memoryOS/.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md` exists as a small
  product-domain memory candidate; Claude absorption-delta log says MemoryOS
  returned null for a URI product task; GenesisOS chamber smoke produced 5
  branches and return paths; Genesis critic flagged assumption/time risks.
- decision: MemoryOS owns the next slice. MyWorld dispatched a draft/review
  task rather than editing MemoryOS accepted-memory state directly.
- result: MemoryOS watcher returned `status=held` with
  `pending_concurrent_work`; dispatch state was marked held with reason
  `pending_concurrent_memoryos_seed_work`.
- risk: MemoryOS is ahead of origin and dirty, so the seed cannot be safely
  processed until the owner isolates or commits that work.
- next: MemoryOS owner/operator should resolve the local seed work, then retry
  `asc-0223` or supersede it with a narrower MemoryOS-local contract.
- status: held

## 2026-06-05 01:36 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0218 GenesisOS DeepIdeaChamber

- when: 2026-06-05 01:36 KST
- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: GenesisOS implementation / MyWorld delegated operator
- goal: promote the DeepIdeaChamber discovery into a repeatable advisory
  GenesisOS surface without granting execution authority.

  `GenesisOS/tests/test_chamber.py`, `GenesisOS/tests/test_cli.py`,
  `GenesisOS/README.md`, `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0218-genesisos-deep-idea-chamber.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: focused GenesisOS tests passed 9/9; full GenesisOS tests passed
  58/58; CLI smoke returned `genesisos.deep_idea_chamber.v1` with 5 branches,
  5 return paths, and `non_outputs` containing `no_execution`; GenesisOS
  `git diff --check` passed; GenesisOS commit `9b213f7` was pushed to
  `origin/main`; parent MyWorld commit records the submodule pointer and
  control-plane contracts.
- decision: `DeepIdeaChamber` is now a local GenesisOS advisory primitive. Its
  contract seeds remain proposals; MyWorld must still accept any future
  execution contract.
- risk: unrelated dirty work remains outside this commit scope:
  `docs/AIOS_CLAUDE_SELF_OBSERVATION_LOG.md` in MyWorld and
  `memoryOS/.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md` plus ahead commits in MemoryOS.
- next: use chamber output to select the next autonomous-development contract
  while preserving unrelated dirty work.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 01:22 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0217 autonomous monitor resilience

- when: 2026-06-05 01:22 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: implementation / delegated operator
- goal: keep autonomous development moving by making monitor snapshot/assess
  tolerate malformed dispatch JSONL without deleting or exposing local state.
- changed: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `scripts/aios_repair_dispatch_log.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_repair_dispatch_log.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0217-autonomous-loop-monitor-resilience.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py
  scripts/aios_repair_dispatch_log.py` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_monitor.py tests/test_aios_repair_dispatch_log.py` passed
  15/15; live repair preserved 88951 valid dispatch lines and quarantined 1
  malformed line under local `.aios/state/`; live monitor snapshot completed
  with `alert_count=0`; live assess completed with `health=watch`; dispatch
  status completed; `git diff --check` passed.
- decision: malformed local dispatch JSONL is now both detectable and
  repairable without deleting evidence or exposing raw local state.
- risk: repair artifacts are local `.aios` state and are not committed; future
  dispatch-log corruption should be handled through the repair utility rather
  than manual truncation.
- next: consider a separate `DeepIdeaChamber` ASC for governed idea
  exploration, or continue autonomous hardening from the next monitor finding.

## 2026-06-04 23:31 KST — codex@myworld — GenesisOS deep idea exploration

- when: 2026-06-04 23:31 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: GenesisOS-assisted discovery
- goal: explore a deep-idea primitive for AIOS without collapsing into normal
  execution.
- changed: `docs/discoveries/2026-06-04-deep-idea-exploration.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS advisory commands produced divergence, critique,
  prompt-prison, discomfort, assumption mutation, analogy, and modality
  outputs; initial wrong-flag attempts were corrected after local `--help`.
- decision: record `DeepIdeaChamber` as speculative discovery and not as
  accepted architecture.
- risk: GenesisOS output is advisory only; no memory acceptance, route binding,
  provider launch, or implementation authority.
- next: operator checkpoint: promote `DeepIdeaChamber` to an ASC contract or
  leave it as discovery evidence.
- status: done

## 2026-05-15 KST — codex — ASC-0077 Genesis semantic alignment kernel

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex
- role: MyWorld shared-language handoff + contract closeout
- goal: close ASC-0077 by aligning MyWorld shared language with the GenesisOS
  semantic kernel and verifying canonical terms, aliases, ambiguity reporting,
  and non-collapse boundaries.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_SHARED_LANGUAGE.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0077-genesisos-semantic-alignment-kernel.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`,
  `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: semantic py_compile passed; GenesisOS semantic/CLI unit tests
  passed 13/13; CLI normalize `작업 장부` mapped to `ledger`; CLI handshake
  emitted `genesisos.semantic_handshake.v1`; CLI diff `contract` vs
  `dispatch packet` returned `same_canonical=false`; GenesisOS full tests
  passed 48/48; MyWorld semantic handshake checker passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 360/360.
- monitor: final `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reported
  `health=attention`; remaining attention is dirty-repo triage, not ASC-0077
  verification failure.
- decision: the shared-language doc now treats GenesisOS canonical anchors as
  advisory semantic anchors compatible with future ASC-0068 discovery
  handshakes. It explicitly preserves the contract/dispatch,
  draft/accepted-memory, and recommendation/provider-route boundaries.
- risk: semantic matching remains deterministic and local; future contracts may
  add project-specific aliases, but should preserve the non-collapse boundary
  table.
- next: accepted GenesisOS sprint queue is clear; proposed Genesis contracts
  require acceptance before implementation.
- status: done

## 2026-05-15 KST — codex — ASC-0075 Genesis seed library

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex
- role: MyWorld wrapper + contract closeout

  append-only library and adding a MyWorld operator-capture wrapper.
- changed: `scripts/aios_genesis_seed_capture.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_genesis_seed_capture.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0075-genesis-seed-library.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`,
  `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS library tests passed 8/8; GenesisOS local unit set
  passed 39/39; GenesisOS CLI capture/list/random smoke wrote
  `lib-665c8b0b316d`; MyWorld wrapper tests passed 2/2; wrapper smoke wrote
  `/tmp/asc0075-seeds/.../lib-d4df6719852f.json`; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 360/360.
- decision: MyWorld captures operator seeds through GenesisOS `Library` and
  records a receipt, but promotion remains an explicit later review path.
- risk: three seed-library entries were created during verification on
  2026-05-15, including two test-origin captures before the wrapper tests were
  tightened to use temp `--seeds-root`. They remain append-only records rather
  than being removed.
- next: continue GenesisOS sprint with ASC-0077 MyWorld shared-language
  handoff.

## 2026-05-15 KST — codex — ASC-0074 Genesis pre-close challenge

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex
- role: implementation + control-plane release gate
- goal: close ASC-0074 by running GenesisOS prompt-prison challenge reports
  before in-registry accepted contract releases and requiring explicit
  operator override for high-risk soft-blocks.
- changed: `GenesisOS/genesisos/challenge.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0074-genesis-pre-close-challenge.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS challenge test passed 1/1; GenesisOS local unit set
  passed 31/31; MyWorld dispatch/challenge tests passed 25/25; standalone
  challenge for `ASC-0050` wrote `.aios/genesis_challenges/ASC-0050.json`
  with `risk_level=high` and `soft_block=true`; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 358/358.
- decision: the release hook applies to `docs/contracts/` registry contracts
  with status `accepted` or `closed`. Proposed and non-registry dispatches
  emit explicit skip events so test fixtures and ad-hoc packets do not mask
  release behavior while real registry closeouts remain challenged.
- risk: the challenge is deterministic and advisory; a broad prompt-prison
  signature set can over-block, so operator override and explicit skip remain
  first-class provenance events.
- next: continue GenesisOS sprint with ASC-0075/ASC-0077 MyWorld handoffs.

## 2026-05-15 KST — claude — CapabilityOS AIOS topology completion

- repo: CapabilityOS + cross-OS evidence refs
- agent: claude (in CapabilityOS session, git author codex@CapabilityOS)
- role: AIOS capability map completion / observation gap closure
- goal: make CapabilityOS structurally represent the full AIOS topology so
  the observation surface stops dropping the majority of result packets as
  `unmapped_repo`. Founder-set session goal: "AIOS로서 CapabilityOS 완성".
- changed: `CapabilityOS/capabilityos/catalog.py` (+3 cards),
  `CapabilityOS/tests/fixtures/capabilities.json` (+3 cards mirrored),
  `CapabilityOS/capabilityos/observation.py` (REPO_CAPABILITY_MAP gains
  `GenesisOS` and `myworld` entries),
  `CapabilityOS/tests/test_cli.py` (drift guard `test_default_catalog_matches_fixture`,
  card-count assertions 11 → 14).
- evidence: CapabilityOS commit `d6656b4`; `python -m pytest` 21 passed;
  `audit --json` reports `status=ok recommendation_only=true
  catalog_complete=true missing_required_kinds=[] execution_enabled=[]`;
  `observe-results --inbox ../.aios/outbox` shows
  `unmapped_repo` gaps 106 → 0, observations 48 → 152 of 162 result files
  (remaining 13 are legitimate `skipped_result`/`non_success_result`).
- decision: catalog now mirrors the 4-OS + control-plane structure of AIOS.
  Two GenesisOS cards (divergence, prompt-prison critic) since the OS has
  two distinct surfaces. One `cap_myworld_operator_control_plane` workflow
  card represents dispatch/contract/ledger/review duties. Cards remain
  recommendation-only (`executes_tools=false`) and `evidence_refs` link to
  existing GenesisOS / myworld artifacts only — no new files in those repos.
- risk: when a repo has more than one capability card, only the one named in
  `REPO_CAPABILITY_MAP` receives observations. memoryOS maps to
  `cap_memoryos_import_run`; the sibling `cap_memoryos_context_build` and
  `cap_genesisos_prompt_prison_critic` accrue no observations. Acceptable for
  now since observations are an advisory confidence signal, not authority.
- next: a future contract may map per-packet `contract_id` to a specific
  card so multi-card OSes split observation credit. Drift guard catches the
  documented dual-source pattern (DEFAULT_CATALOG + fixture); deeper
  consolidation is a separate cleanup.

  `tests/test_aios_genesis_analogy.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0073-genesis-cross-domain-analogy.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS analogy tests passed 4/4; GenesisOS local unit set
  passed 30/30; raw CLI match returned three ranked analogies; raw CLI add
  wrote operator-attributed entry `biology-test-561c6a08`; MyWorld wrapper
  tests passed 2/2; wrapper CLI wrote top analogies for `ASC-0050`; full
  MyWorld `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 356/356.
- decision: analogy matches are advisory only and cannot execute, create
  contracts, accept memory, or route capabilities.
- risk: bag-of-terms matching is intentionally simple and can produce broad
  ties; later contracts may weight MemoryOS context or accepted domain maps.
- next: continue GenesisOS sprint with ASC-0074 pre-close challenge.

## 2026-05-15 KST — codex — ASC-0072 Genesis multi-modal reasoning

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex
- role: implementation + control-plane wrapper
- goal: close ASC-0072 by adding deterministic non-language modality
  translations and a MyWorld artifact writer for contract/draft comparison.
- changed: `GenesisOS/genesisos/modalities.py`, `GenesisOS/genesisos/cli.py`,
  `GenesisOS/tests/test_modalities.py`, `GenesisOS/docs/MULTI_MODAL.md`,
  `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `scripts/aios_genesis_modal.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_genesis_modal.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0072-genesis-multi-modal-reasoning.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS modality tests passed 4/4; GenesisOS local unit set
  passed 26/26; raw CLI compare emitted six non-empty modalities; MyWorld
  wrapper tests passed 2/2; wrapper CLI wrote an ASC-0072 modal view artifact
  under `.aios/genesis_modal_views/`; full MyWorld `test_aios_*.py`
  discovery passed 352/352.
- decision: V1 modality adapters are deterministic heuristics only. They are
  advisory prompt-prison escape surfaces, not proof, execution, memory
  acceptance, or capability routing.
- risk: heuristic entity extraction can over-focus on frontmatter keys; later
  contracts may add body-aware extraction or local LLM adapters under a new
  verification gate.
- next: continue GenesisOS sprint with ASC-0073 cross-domain analogy.
- status: done

## 2026-05-15 KST — codex — ASC-0071 Genesis multi-universe branches

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex
- role: implementation + control-plane wrapper
- goal: close ASC-0071 by adding speculative multi-universe branches for a
  goal, explicit operator collapse, and a MyWorld wrapper for goal documents.
- changed: `GenesisOS/genesisos/branches.py`, `GenesisOS/genesisos/cli.py`,
  `GenesisOS/tests/test_branches.py`, `GenesisOS/docs/MULTI_UNIVERSE.md`,
  `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `scripts/aios_genesis_branch.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_genesis_branch.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0071-genesis-multi-universe-branches.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS branch tests passed 5/5; GenesisOS local unit set passed
  22/22; raw CLI fork/list/collapse produced three branches, one explicit
  winner, and collapsed losers; MyWorld wrapper tests passed 2/2; full
  MyWorld `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 350/350; monitor assessment
  completed with `health=attention` due dirty-worktree triage and advisory
  Genesis/persona findings, not ASC-0071 gate failure.
- decision: branch collapse is explicit and operator-facing; GenesisOS never
  auto-selects a winner or creates a contract from a branch.
- risk: current branch state files are current-state JSON while fork/collapse
  events are append-only; if AIOS later needs immutable branch-state versions,
  make that a follow-up contract.
- next: continue GenesisOS sprint with ASC-0072 multi-modal reasoning, unless
  operator chooses to review generated branch/seed candidates first.
- status: done

## 2026-05-15 KST — codex — ASC-0070 Genesis assumption mutator

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- agent: codex
- role: implementation + control-plane wrapper
- goal: close ASC-0070 by adding deterministic GenesisOS assumption mutation
  seeds and a MyWorld wrapper that writes reviewed seed candidates to the local
  `.aios/genesis_seed_inbox/`.
- changed: `GenesisOS/genesisos/mutator.py`, `GenesisOS/genesisos/cli.py`,
  `GenesisOS/tests/test_mutator.py`, `GenesisOS/docs/ASSUMPTION_MUTATION.md`,
  `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `scripts/aios_genesis_mutate.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_genesis_mutate.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0070-genesis-assumption-mutator.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS mutator tests passed 9/9; GenesisOS full local unit set
  passed 17/17; the raw GenesisOS CLI emitted six `/tmp/sample_contract.md`
  seeds and rerun reported `skipped_existing`; MyWorld wrapper tests passed
  2/2; wrapper CLI emitted six candidate seeds each for `ASC-0050` and
  `ASC-0070` under `.aios/genesis_seed_inbox/`; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 346/346; monitor assessment completed
  with `health=attention` due dirty-worktree triage, not ASC-0070 test
  failure.
- decision: assumption mutations are candidate seeds only; source contracts are
  not mutated and promotion remains a separate MyWorld operator review step.
- risk: MyWorld root already has substantial unrelated dirty state, so this
  entry records only the scoped ASC-0070 additions and avoids interpreting the
  broader worktree.
- next: use the seed inbox review path to decide whether any ASC-0070 seed
  should become a separate MyWorld contract.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — claude — ASC-0089 Hive debate: ASC-0088 alternatives verdict

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- agent: claude
- role: operator (Hive debate executor)
- goal: Adversarial Hive deliberation on ASC-0088 alternatives (B1-B5) for AIOS Universal Agent Interface shape, after founder flagged B5 auto-accept as prompt-prison.
- changed: `hivemind/.runs/asc0088_alternatives_debate/` (20 debate artifacts + final_state.md), `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-hive-asc0088-alternatives-debate-result.md`, `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`
- evidence: 5-round debate, 3 voices/round, 7/7 probes addressed, unanimous verdict
- decision: **pick_B1** — tiny spec (~50-80 lines), permanent substrate-neutral protocol definition. B2/B5 eliminated, B4/B3 deferred as optional layers. ASC-0088 to be superseded with B1-scoped successor contract.
- risk: B1 may prove insufficient for automated delivery (proposer dissent: B4 needed within 6 months). Mitigated by layered architecture allowing optional B4/B3 addition based on evidence.
- next: claude@myworld executes WP-0089-B — supersede ASC-0088, draft successor contract with 7 design requirements (DR-1 through DR-7).
- status: done (WP-0089-A complete, WP-0089-B pending)

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri sprint dogfood: always-on MyWorld and capability provisioning gap

- repo: myworld + uri
- role: implementation + control-plane observation
- goal: dogfood MyWorld as an always-on control plane while building Uri's
  first mobile-first web product slice through Hive/Memory/Capability artifacts.
- changed: Uri child repo gained Sprint 001 web prototype artifacts and app
  implementation; MyWorld ledger records cross-OS improvement needs only.
- evidence: Uri local checks passed: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`,
  Playwright route check for `/u/ulsan`, `/connect`, `/me`, `/memory`; browser
  screenshots saved under `uri/.runs/visual-check/`; route check found no Next
  overlay, nonblank content, no mobile horizontal overflow, and successful
  trace interaction.
- decision: future product repos should be able to throw one goal at MyWorld
  and have it continuously route work through Hive Mind, MemoryOS, and
  CapabilityOS while feeding gaps back into MyWorld.
- risk: current CapabilityOS doctrine says early versions recommend tools but
  do not install/bind them, while this sprint needed capability-style
  provisioning when Playwright browser/runtime was missing. This should become
  an explicit reviewed BindingPlan or provisioning contract rather than ad hoc
  installation inside a product repo.
- next: draft a MyWorld/CapabilityOS improvement contract for capability
  provisioning: detect missing tools, install when allowed, record receipts,
  define fallback, and feed observations into CapabilityOS without violating
  Hive execution ownership.
- status: proposed

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri app/platform direction and campus graph

- repo: myworld + uri
- role: product implementation observation
- goal: record the founder direction that Uri must be both a fun/useful campus
  app and a platform that creates one MemoryOS-compatible graph per campus.
- changed: Uri child repo updated product docs, Hive/Memory/Capability sprint
  artifacts, and `/u/[schoolSlug]` implementation; MyWorld ledger records the
  cross-OS implication.
- evidence: Uri Sprint 002 verification passed: `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm run build`, Playwright screenshot checks for map-first `/u/ulsan`, and
  interaction check confirming cell selection plus map spark after trace
  creation.
- decision: Uri should be `App first, Platform second`: the app creates lived
  campus interaction; the platform converts that interaction into campus
  graphs, memories, experiences, capabilities, and operating surfaces.
- risk: one-campus-one-MemoryOS-graph is not yet a reviewed MemoryOS schema.
  Current implementation is graph-ready local state only.
- next: draft an ASC or Uri contract for CampusGraph schema review across Uri,
  MemoryOS, and CapabilityOS before durable graph persistence or real source
  ingestion.
- status: proposed

## 2026-05-12 14:33 KST — codex — Uri child repo isolated

- repo: myworld + uri
- role: implementation
- goal: set up Uri as a lower repo so student digital campus product work does
  not mix into the MyWorld control-plane root.
- changed: `uri/` standalone git repo, `uri` private remote
  `cjw0076/uri-v3`, `.gitmodules`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0032-uri-repo-isolation-setup.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: Uri commits `8f1621f` and `f0edcbb` pushed to
  `https://github.com/cjw0076/uri-v3`; MyWorld tracks `uri` as a gitlink and
  keeps product docs inside the child repo.
- decision: Uri workflow assetization is allowed only from public/open-source
  sources and clean-room inferred patterns; nonpublic company tools or code are
  stop conditions, not targets to bypass.
- risk: first Uri AIOS execution loop still needs a follow-up contract to route
  research through MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, and Hive Mind.
- next: draft the first Uri research/prototype contract and dispatch it through
  the AIOS control plane.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 KST — codex — MyWorld AIOS shared docs bootstrap

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: create root-level files that Hive Mind, MemoryOS, and CapabilityOS
  agents can read while converging on the final AIOS.
- changed: `AGENTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/AIOS_SMART_CONTRACT.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `docs/agents/*.md`
- evidence: docs-only bootstrap from operator instruction.
- decision: shared agent records need more than `when/repo/agent`; they should
  include role, goal, changed artifacts, evidence, decision, risk, next owner,
  and status.
- risk: myworld root is not currently a clean standalone git repo; avoid
  broad git operations from this root.
- next: each OS agent should add future cross-repo records here and keep
  repo-local worklogs in sync.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 KST — codex — MyWorld dispatch model

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: define how myworld should assign work without becoming a generic worker
  repo.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`, `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: docs-only update from operator clarification.
- decision: myworld is the control plane that writes contracts and dispatch
  packets; implementation agents run inside `hivemind/`, `memoryOS/`, or
  `CapabilityOS/` according to ownership.
- risk: unclear ownership can still cause cross-repo edits; use operator
  checkpoints when owner repo is ambiguous.
- next: create `docs/contracts/ASC-0001-*.md` before the next cross-repo sprint.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 KST — codex — Control tower wording

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: clarify the operator's intended metaphor for myworld.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`, `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: docs-only clarification.
- decision: describe `myworld/` as the AIOS control tower: it coordinates,
  dispatches, holds, and releases work, while implementation happens in the
  owning lower repo.
- risk: none known.
- next: use this metaphor in future contracts and agent onboarding.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 KST — codex — AIOS pingpong shell entrypoint

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: provide one shell entrypoint that can run Codex and Claude as
  alternating myworld control-tower agents until the AIOS north star is marked
  ready.
- changed: `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: `bash -n scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`; status command available via
  `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh status`.
- decision: loop stops only on `.aios/STOP`, `.aios/NORTHSTAR_READY`,
  `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR_READY.md`, or optional `AIOS_MAX_ROUNDS`.
- risk: this can run real Codex/Claude CLI commands; use `once` or
  `AIOS_MAX_ROUNDS` for bounded trials before long-running automation.
- next: run `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh once` for a single smoke turn, then
  `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh start` only if the operator accepts the behavior.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 20:55 KST — codex — Shared docs usage adopted

- repo: myworld
- role: operator
- goal: confirm how agents should use `/home/user/workspaces/jaewon/myworld/docs`
  while working across Hive Mind, MemoryOS, and CapabilityOS.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md` entry only.
- evidence: read `docs/README.md`, `AIOS_NORTHSTAR.md`,
  `AIOS_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `AIOS_SMART_CONTRACT.md`,
  `AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and `docs/agents/*.md`.
- decision: root docs are the shared cross-OS contract surface. For future
  cross-OS work, read them before acting; keep implementation details in each
  repo; write repo-local worklogs for local changes; write this ledger for
  cross-repo decisions, boundary changes, and AIOS-level contracts.
- risk: root `myworld` may not be a clean standalone git repo, so avoid broad
  root-level git operations.
- next: when a task crosses OS boundaries, draft or reference an AIOS smart
  contract and stop at an operator checkpoint if scope, permissions, or required
  artifacts are ambiguous.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 21:08 KST — codex — Codex and Claude AIOS direction protocol

- repo: myworld
- role: planner
- goal: establish how Codex and Claude should jointly direct Hive Mind,
  MemoryOS, and CapabilityOS.
- changed: `docs/WORKSTREAMS.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: read root AIOS docs plus `docs/agents/HIVEMIND_AGENT.md`,
  `docs/agents/MEMORYOS_AGENT.md`, and
  `docs/agents/CAPABILITYOS_AGENT.md`.
- decision: Codex leads implementation, tests, execution receipts, and
  verification; Claude leads architecture critique, policy/lifecycle review,
  privacy wording, and OS-boundary coherence. Cross-OS work remains
  contract-bound and must preserve repo ownership.
- risk: broad parent workspace git status includes many unrelated changes; use
  repo-local status checks before implementation.
- next: for the next concrete AIOS task, create or reference an AIOS smart
  contract, then route MemoryOS context, CapabilityOS recommendations, and Hive
  Mind execution in that order.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 21:17 KST — codex — MyWorld root split to superproject

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: detach `myworld/` from the parent workspace git root and make it the
  AIOS coordination root.
- changed: `.gitignore`, `.gitmodules`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`,
  parent `../.gitignore`
- evidence: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` now resolves to
  `/home/user/workspaces/jaewon/myworld` after initialization.
- decision: keep `hivemind/`, `memoryOS/`, and `CapabilityOS/` as independent
  git repositories referenced from `myworld` as submodule-style gitlinks;
  do not absorb their working trees into the root repo.
- risk: subrepos may have local uncommitted changes; root commit should record
  only the subrepo HEAD gitlinks and not alter subrepo worktrees.
- next: commit the new `myworld` superproject root, then continue OS-specific
  work inside each child repository.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 21:35 KST — claude — ASC-0001 lifecycle proposed -> accepted -> closed (dogfood)

- repo: myworld
- role: review + dogfood operator
- goal: take ASC-0001 (memoryOS<->hivemind loop) through full control-plane
  lifecycle in one session: snapshot 3 repos, review codex's draft, accept,
  dispatch via `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, run verification gate, close.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0001-memoryos-hivemind-loop.md` (frontmatter
  status proposed -> accepted -> closed; slug field added; Receipts section
  filled), `docs/contracts/README.md` (index status sync proposed -> accepted
  -> closed), `.aios/inbox/{hivemind,memoryOS}/asc-0001.*.json` (dispatched
  packets), `.aios/outbox/{hivemind,memoryOS}/asc-0001.*.result.json`
  (verification results), `.aios/state/dispatches.jsonl` (created/sent/
  collected events).
- evidence: hivemind verification 1 passed in 1.56s
  (`tests/test_quickstart.py::QuickstartDemoTest::test_memory_loop_demo_closes_isolated_feedback_loop`);
  memoryOS verification 2 passed in 0.29s (k57 reviewed-drafts and json
  privacy tests). Both result packets collected without stop conditions.
  Acceptance commit `a85221b`.
- decision: ASC-0001 closed. The hive<->memory loop is real and executable
  end-to-end through the control-plane dispatch surface. ASC-0002 should be
  CapabilityOS first executable surface (still 0% code, blocking any
  capability route work in hivemind).
- risk: verification packets self-executed by `claude@myworld` because no
  child-repo agent (codex@hivemind, codex@memoryOS) was active; this is
  acceptable for read-only test gates but must not become the default for
  contracts whose work involves writing child-repo code. The dispatch
  packets carry no `task_brief` or `verification_commands` extracted from
  the contract — child agents currently must re-derive their slice from
  the contract body.
- next: (1) operator decides whether to draft ASC-0002 (CapabilityOS first
  executable surface) now or capture dogfood findings first;
  (2) recommend small improvements to `scripts/aios_dispatch.py` packet
  shape (see chat findings list); (3) record the inline `## Work Packets`
  section convention vs JSON dispatch packet relationship in
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:00 KST — claude — ASC-0002 closed; ASC-0004 issued for watcher+state-machine

- repo: myworld
- role: review + control plane direction
- goal: close ASC-0002 after Codex's V1 implementation, resolve the ASC-0003
  ID collision surfaced by Codex's counter-proposal, and issue ASC-0004 for
  the largest gap from ASC-0001 dogfood (no watcher; no release/hold/retry/
  escalate state machine) per operator directive 2026-05-11 KST.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0002-capabilityos-executable-surface.md`
  (frontmatter status accepted -> closed; WP-0002-B status issued -> done
  with PASS verdict and ID-collision note; Receipts section augmented),
  `docs/contracts/README.md` (ASC-0002 status closed; ASC-0004 row added),
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0004-dispatch-watcher-and-state-machine.md` (new
  stub with Q1-Q7, scope/per-OS/gate/stop stubs, WP-0004-A inline
  packet).
- evidence: independent re-run of ASC-0002 verification gate at 22:00 KST:
  `cd CapabilityOS && python -m pytest` -> 4 passed in 0.18s; recommend
  smoke returned substantive ranked recommendations with score, reason_codes,
  fallback_ids per Q2 schema. WP-0002-B PASS recorded in contract body.
- decision: (1) Counter-proposal in ASC-0002 ACCEPTED -- hive
  `capability_bridge.py` is a separate contract, not in ASC-0002.
  (2) ID conflict -- the counter-proposal calls the bridge contract
  "ASC-0003" but ASC-0003 is already taken by `dispatch-packet-enrichment`
  (commit `c6e9f5a`). The bridge work, when issued, becomes ASC-0005
  (after ASC-0004 watcher/state-machine per operator priority).
  (3) ASC-0004 prioritized over ASC-0003 per operator. ASC-0003 stays
  `proposed`; ASC-0004 also stays `proposed` pending operator acceptance.
- risk: ASC-0002 V1 implementation in CapabilityOS package is uncommitted in
  CapabilityOS git (`pyproject.toml`, `capabilityos/`, `tests/` untracked
  per `git -C CapabilityOS status`). Codex@CapabilityOS owns that commit;
  myworld control plane should not commit child-repo source.
- next: (1) operator decides ASC-0004 acceptance (and optionally ASC-0003);
  (2) Codex@CapabilityOS commits the V1 package in CapabilityOS git;
  (3) when Codex's hive `capability_bridge.py` work surfaces, draft as
  ASC-0005.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:30 KST — claude — Operator role consolidated; ASC-0004 closed; ASC-0005 issued

- repo: myworld
- role: operator (per founder directive 2026-05-11 KST delegating routine
  acting-operator authority to the claude+codex pair)
- goal: consolidate the operator-role redefinition into durable docs, close
  ASC-0004 after Codex's parallel implementation, and pre-issue ASC-0005 for
  the hive capability_bridge work that ASC-0002's counter-proposal called
  out.
- changed: `docs/WORKSTREAMS.md` (operator row split into operator pair +
  founder; escalation rules added), `CLAUDE.md` (control plane workflow
  updated to reflect operator-pair authority), `docs/contracts/ASC-0004-*.md`
  (frontmatter accepted+closed; receipts populated; WP-0004-A status done),
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0005-*.md` (new stub, accepted),
  `docs/contracts/README.md` (ASC-0004 status closed; ASC-0005 row added).
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch tests.test_aios_loop
  tests.test_aios_monitor` -> 8 OK in 0.806s. Watcher dogfood replay of
  ASC-0001 (dispatch_id `asc-0001-watcher-replay`) -> both repos collected
  status `passed` with NO manual pytest invocation. First session in which
  AIOS auto-closed a verification gate.
- decision: (1) Operator role expanded -- claude+codex jointly hold routine
  acceptance/release/hold/retry/escalate authority; founder reserves vision,
  privacy, scope-policy, and override. Escalation rules listed in
  WORKSTREAMS.md.
  (2) ASC-0004 accepted and closed in the same session (acceptance
  authority: claude@myworld; closure verification: independent watcher
  replay).
  (3) ASC-0005 (hive capability_bridge) created and accepted; resolves the
  ID-collision note in ASC-0002's counter-proposal (which incorrectly named
  the bridge work "ASC-0003"; ASC-0003 was already taken).
- risk: Codex implementation in `scripts/aios_loop.py`, `scripts/
  aios_monitor.py`, and `tests/test_aios_loop.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`
  is in working tree; the closing operator commit by claude@myworld will
  also stage these because they are myworld-scope (not child-repo source).
  CapabilityOS V1 source remains uncommitted in CapabilityOS git --
  codex@CapabilityOS still owns that commit.
- next: (1) commit Codex's ASC-0004 implementation + this closure;
  (2) wake codex@hivemind to pick up WP-0005-A (capability_bridge);
  (3) decide ASC-0003 (packet enrichment) acceptance now that ASC-0004
  has landed and includes a minimal command extractor (Q4 of ASC-0004
  body); ASC-0003 may want to refactor rather than re-implement.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:11 KST — codex — ASC-0005 released through control-plane dispatch

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: acting operator + supervisor
- goal: wake `codex@hivemind` through the AIOS dispatch loop and close the
  Hive CapabilityOS bridge contract.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0005-hive-capability-bridge.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `.aios/inbox/hivemind/asc-0005.hivemind.json`,
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0005.hivemind.result.json`, and Hive-owned files
  reported in the result packet.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_loop.py once --apply --json` created and sent
  dispatch `asc-0005`; worker result packet returned `status: passed`;
  operator re-ran `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_capability_bridge.py -v`
  -> 4 passed and `python -m pytest tests/test_quickstart.py -v` -> 4 passed.
- decision: release `asc-0005` after correcting contract scope to allow the
  repo-required `hivemind/.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md` worklog while keeping
  other `.ai-runs/**` paths forbidden. CapabilityOS remains recommendation-only
  and read-only from Hive.
- risk: Hive has pre-existing dirty `hivemind/hive.py` changes unrelated to
  ASC-0005. CapabilityOS V1 source is still uncommitted in its own repo.
- next: accept or revise ASC-0003 so dispatch packets carry the same
  verification and task-slice data the watcher currently extracts from
  contracts.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:20 KST — codex — ASC-0003 packet enrichment closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: remove packet ambiguity so child agents do not have to re-derive their
  task slice from full contract prose.
- changed: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `scripts/aios_loop.py`,
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0003-dispatch-packet-enrichment.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.

  passed; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_loop.py tests/test_aios_monitor.py`
  -> 12 tests OK; `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`
  passed; ASC-0001 enriched MemoryOS replay produced a packet with
  `must_produce`, `verification_commands`, `result_schema_version`, and
  `result_contract`, then watcher verification passed and dispatch was
  released.
- decision: keep `aios.dispatch.v1` and add optional enrichment fields rather
  than creating a breaking v2. Validate `aios.dispatch.result.v1` on collect.
- risk: parser is intentionally simple Markdown parsing, not a full Markdown
  AST. Future contract shapes should preserve current heading/bullet patterns
  or extend parser tests first.
- next: move from L4/L5 pieces toward L6 repeatability by adding a readiness
  gate that proves one goal can traverse contract -> context -> capability ->
  execution -> verification -> memory/capability observation -> closeout
  without chat context.

## 2026-05-11 22:20 KST — codex — ASC-0006 L6 readiness gate closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: prevent overclaiming AIOS completion by turning
  `docs/AIOS_DEFINITION.md` L0-L6 into a local readiness command.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0006-aios-l6-repeatable-proof.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `scripts/aios_readiness.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_readiness.py`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_readiness.py scripts/aios_dispatch.py scripts/aios_loop.py scripts/aios_monitor.py`
  passed; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_readiness.py tests/test_aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_loop.py tests/test_aios_monitor.py`
  -> 14 tests OK; readiness first stopped at L5 until ASC-0006 closeout,
  proving the gate does not self-certify early.
- decision: L6 must be machine-checked by `python scripts/aios_readiness.py --json`.
  The gate requires closed core contracts, no pending packets, watcher scripts,
  dispatch/result evidence, and MemoryOS/CapabilityOS/Hive participation.
- risk: readiness is evidence-structural, not semantic proof of product
  usefulness. Future contracts should add deeper semantic quality gates.
- next: rerun readiness after this closeout. If it returns `ready=true`, write
  `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR_READY.md`; otherwise continue from its next action.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:21 KST — codex — AIOS L6 readiness marked

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator
- goal: mark the point where the loop may stop because AIOS reached the
  strict L6 repeatable gate.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR_READY.md`, `.aios/NORTHSTAR_READY` runtime
  marker.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_readiness.py --json` returned
  `ready=true`, `level=6`, `level_name=L6 repeatable`, `gaps=[]`;
  `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh status` reports `northstar_ready=true`;
  child watchers report `pending=0` for hivemind, memoryOS, and CapabilityOS.
- decision: the current AIOS is operationally repeatable, not product-complete.
  Future work should improve semantic quality gates, child repo cleanup, and
  long-running watcher supervision.
- risk: L6 is a structural readiness claim. It does not mean the product is
  polished, committed, or semantically robust.
- next: commit control-plane changes, then clean/commit child repo work under
  each repo's own policy.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 KST — codex — AIOS strict definition and child watcher prompt guard

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: define AIOS tightly enough that agents cannot claim progress through
  shallow shortcuts, and apply that definition to myworld/child watcher prompts.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_DEFINITION.md`, `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR.md`,
  `docs/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: docs and prompt contract update.
- decision: AIOS progress must be reported through explicit levels from L0
  described to L6 repeatable; missing ownership, memory, capability,
  verification, or durable record means checkpoint/gap, not completion.
- risk: none known.
- next: finish verifying the child watcher wiring and document how to start it.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 KST — codex — Child repo watcher bridge

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: attach lower-repo watchers so myworld can wake repo-local agents from
  inbox packets instead of only producing dispatch files.
- changed: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- evidence: `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`; `bash -n
  scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`; `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh status`;
  `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh status`.
- decision: child watchers are opt-in. Run `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once
  --repo <repo>` for a bounded packet, or start all watchers with
  `AIOS_START_CHILD_WATCHERS=1 scripts/aios_pingpong.sh start`.
- risk: child watchers invoke real Codex/Claude CLI inside lower repos; do not
  start broad automation unless the active contracts and repo states are
  acceptable.
- next: dogfood one bounded packet before long-running `start --repo all`.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:34 KST — codex — ASC-0007 doc scout task radar closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: keep the post-L6 AIOS loop moving by searching workspace docs for
  durable task signals and turning them into next contract candidates.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0007-workspace-doc-scout-task-radar.md`,
  `scripts/aios_doc_scout.py`, `tests/test_aios_doc_scout.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_TASK_RADAR.md`, `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,

  tests/test_aios_doc_scout.py tests/test_aios_readiness.py
  tests/test_aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_loop.py tests/test_aios_monitor.py`
  -> 16 tests OK; doc scout generated `docs/AIOS_TASK_RADAR.md` with
  `schema_version=aios.doc_scout.v1`, 1679 docs scanned, 1067 docs with
  signals, and ASC-0008..ASC-0012 follow-up candidates.
- decision: L6 readiness no longer means the operator loop has to stop.
  `AIOS_CONTINUE_AFTER_READY=1` makes continuation explicit; the doc scout is
  the first post-ready task generator and excludes runtime, dependency,
  raw-data, export, log, weight, secret, and credential paths.
- risk: the radar is heuristic and path/signal based. Each proposed follow-up
  contract must re-read its source docs under bounded scope before dispatching
  implementation work.
- next: dispatch ASC-0008 to MemoryOS, ASC-0009 to CapabilityOS, ASC-0010 to
  Hive, and ASC-0011 to myworld once their scopes are accepted.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:49 KST — codex — ASC-0011 loop policy closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: make the post-radar loop controllable by ranking candidate work as
  accept, capacity hold, capability hold, operator hold, or out-of-scope reject.
- changed: `scripts/aios_loop_policy.py`, `tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0011-control-plane-loop-policy.md`,

  tests/test_aios_readiness.py tests/test_aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_loop.py
  tests/test_aios_monitor.py` -> 18 tests OK; `python
  scripts/aios_loop_policy.py --json --write docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`
  produced `schema_version=aios.loop_policy.v1`, `open_contract_count=3`,
  `capacity=4`, and 40 decisions after ASC-0011 closeout; `aios_dispatch.py watch --repo myworld
  --dispatch-id asc-0011 --once` passed, then collect/release succeeded.
- decision: the loop may continue after L6, but it must not auto-accept work.
  `_from_desktop/`, `dain/`, and `minyoung/` paths are always operator holds;
  capacity defaults to 4 open contracts; policy output is advisory only.
- risk: semantic verdicts are still heuristic until ASC-0010 Hive radar review
  lands. ASC-0011 is a guardrail, not a full planner.
- next: monitor ASC-0008 memoryOS, ASC-0009 CapabilityOS, and ASC-0010
  hivemind worker results; when they return, collect and close or hold based on
  evidence.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:50 KST — codex — ASC-0008 through ASC-0010 closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator
- goal: collect and close the MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, and Hive follow-up
  contracts spawned by the ASC-0007 task radar.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0008-workspace-doc-ingest-memoryos.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0009-capability-observation-feedback.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0010-hive-semantic-quality-gate.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: ASC-0008 `python -m pytest tests/test_doc_radar_ingest.py -v`
  passed 3/3 and `aios_dispatch.py watch --repo memoryOS --dispatch-id
  asc-0008 --once` passed; ASC-0009 `python -m pytest tests/test_cli.py
  tests/test_observation.py -v` passed 9/9, `capabilityos.cli audit --json`
  preserved `recommendation_only=true`, and watcher passed; ASC-0010
  `python -m pytest tests/test_radar_review.py -v` passed 2/2 and watcher
  passed. All three result packets were collected and released.
- decision: close ASC-0008, ASC-0009, and ASC-0010. MemoryOS now has a
  metadata-only doc-radar ingest path; CapabilityOS can observe dispatch
  results without execution creep; Hive can run a deterministic radar semantic
  review without external LLM calls.
- risk: child repos remain dirty with implementation changes and pre-existing
  unrelated edits. Do not collapse those into a myworld commit; commit them in
  each child repo under repo-local policy.
- next: run monitor/readiness, then continue from `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`;
  the next likely accepted candidate is a Hive worklog/gap cleanup packet unless
  CapabilityOS gaps should be prioritized.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:50 KST — codex — ASC-0012 durability closeout issued

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator
- goal: prevent the radar feedback loop from closing only in myworld while
  child repo implementation changes remain non-durable.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0012-child-repo-durability-closeout.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `git -C memoryOS status --short`, `git -C CapabilityOS status
  --short`, and `git -C hivemind status --short` show implementation changes
  from ASC-0008, ASC-0009, ASC-0010, plus pre-existing dirty files.
- decision: issue ASC-0012 before starting another feature contract. Each child
  repo must either commit its owned slice locally or return a hold reason.
- risk: commits can accidentally absorb unrelated dirty files; ASC-0012
  explicitly forbids runtime/raw/private paths and allows held results.
- next: dispatch ASC-0012 to memoryOS, CapabilityOS, and hivemind.
- status: issued

## 2026-05-11 22:55 KST — codex — ASC-0012 durability closeout closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator
- goal: make child repo implementations from ASC-0008, ASC-0009, and ASC-0010
  durable through repo-local commits or explicit holds.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0012-child-repo-durability-closeout.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`; child repo commits
  `memoryOS@52ea40e`, `CapabilityOS@a1fd15d`, `hivemind@6320492`.
- evidence: memoryOS `tests/test_doc_radar_ingest.py` passed 3/3;
  CapabilityOS `tests/test_cli.py tests/test_observation.py` passed 9/9 and
  audit preserved recommendation-only; hivemind `tests/test_capability_bridge.py
  tests/test_radar_review.py` passed 6/6 and radar-review smoke returned 10
  entries. ASC-0012 result packets were collected for all three repos and
  dispatch was released.
- decision: close ASC-0012. Leave unrelated/forbidden dirty files uncommitted:
  `memoryOS/data/**`, memoryOS pre-existing worklog hunk,
  `hivemind/.ai-runs/**`, and ambiguous `hivemind/harness.py`.
- risk: myworld gitlinks now point at older child commit SHAs until the
  superproject records updated gitlink pointers.
- next: update myworld gitlinks for child repo commits, rerun readiness and
  monitor, then continue from loop policy.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:02 KST — codex — ASC-0013 instruction index closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: make repo instruction surfaces discoverable without chat context.
- changed: `scripts/aios_instruction_index.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_instruction_index.py`, `docs/AIOS_INSTRUCTION_INDEX.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0013-workspace-instruction-index.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_instruction_index.py` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_instruction_index.py` passed 2/2; full
  myworld unittest suite passed 23 tests; instruction index command produced
  `schema_version=aios.instruction_index.v1` and 12 instruction files across
  myworld, hivemind, memoryOS, and CapabilityOS; dispatch watch/collect/release
  for `asc-0013` passed.
- decision: close ASC-0013. The index is metadata-only and excludes runtime,
  raw-data, export, log, and weight paths.
- risk: the index records headings and signal counts, not full instructions;
  agents must still open the source instruction file before acting.
- next: rerun radar/policy; likely next contract is ASC-0014 Hive worklog/gap
  cleanup or ASC-0015 capability-gap triage.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:42 KST — codex — ASC-0014 monitor hygiene closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: remove monitor false positives from normal release/closeout state.
- changed: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0014-control-plane-monitor-hygiene.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py` passed; `python -m
  unittest tests/test_aios_monitor.py` passed 4/4; `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json` now reports 3 alerts instead of 12:
  one legacy ASC-0001 proposed-to-closed drift plus the two real child repo
  dirty alerts.
- decision: monitor now treats `accepted -> closed` as expected progression and
  normalizes repo-suffixed collected ids such as `asc-0012.CapabilityOS` to the
  base dispatch id for summary/pending checks.
- risk: proposed-to-closed drift remains visible by design; that is not hidden
  as a normal release.
- next: handle the remaining child repo dirty state through a separate hygiene
  contract.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:48 KST — codex — ASC-0015 child repo dirty triage closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + durability closeout
- goal: resolve the remaining memoryOS and hivemind dirty files after ASC-0012
  and ASC-0014.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0015-child-repo-dirty-triage.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, child gitlinks for
  `memoryOS` and `hivemind`.
- evidence: `memoryOS` committed `f227454` with only
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md` and `data/README.md`; raw `data/*` exports remain
  ignored. `hivemind` committed `101d769` with only
  `.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md` and `hivemind/harness.py`.
  `cd memoryOS && git diff --check` passed.
  `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_capability_bridge.py
  tests/test_quickstart.py -v` passed 8/8. `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json` reports no child repo dirty alerts.
- decision: commit the two repo-local documentation files in memoryOS, commit
  the ASC-0005 residual harness integration and tracked shared comms log in
  hivemind, and leave only the legacy ASC-0001 dispatch status drift as a
  separate monitor-history issue.
- risk: ASC-0001 `proposed -> closed` stale dispatch alert remains visible by
  design; it should be handled by a future runtime-state reconciliation
  contract if operator wants a zero-alert monitor.
- next: rerun full myworld regression suite and commit ASC-0015 closeout.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:52 KST — codex — ASC-0016 monitor reconciliation registry closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: clear the final known monitor alert without mutating append-only
  dispatch runtime history.
- changed: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_MONITOR_RECONCILIATIONS.json`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0016-monitor-reconciliation-registry.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py` passed. Reconciliation
  regression coverage passed in `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_monitor.py`.
  `python -m json.tool docs/AIOS_MONITOR_RECONCILIATIONS.json >/dev/null` passed. `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json --fail-on-alert` exited zero with
  `alerts=[]` and one `reconciliations_applied` entry for the exact ASC-0001
  bootstrap status drift.
- decision: preserve `.aios/state/dispatches.jsonl` as append-only evidence and
  reconcile only exact committed alert fingerprints.
- risk: future stale drift must not be added casually; every reconciliation
  needs a contract, exact match, and reason.
- next: rerun full myworld regression suite, readiness, and loop policy; issue
  the next accepted work packet from radar if monitor remains clean.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:57 KST — codex — ASC-0017 control-plane monitor sidecar closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation

  monitor sidecar.
- changed: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0017-control-plane-monitor-sidecar.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py` passed. `python -m
  unittest tests/test_aios_monitor.py` passed 8/8. `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py run --iterations 1 --interval 1 --quiet` exited zero.
  `python scripts/aios_monitor.py status --json` exited zero and reported no
  running sidecar after the bounded run. `python scripts/aios_monitor.py
  snapshot --json --fail-on-alert` exited zero.
- decision: sidecar is observer-only. It writes `.aios/state/monitor.jsonl`,
  `.aios/state/monitor.latest.json`, `.aios/state/monitor_events.jsonl`, and
  PID/stop files under `.aios/run/`; those runtime artifacts remain
  uncommitted.
- risk: long-running monitor must not dispatch work or mutate contracts; it is
  a signal source for the next contract, not an executor.
- next: start the sidecar when an ongoing autonomous session needs persistent
  observation, then let loop policy choose the next accepted contract.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:58 KST — codex — ASC-0018 loop policy source hygiene closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: prevent the loop policy from accepting already-closed contract
  documents as new executable work.
- changed: `scripts/aios_loop_policy.py`, `tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0018-loop-policy-source-hygiene.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py` passed 2/2.
  `python scripts/aios_loop_policy.py --write docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md --json`
  showed closed `docs/contracts/ASC-*.md` sources as
  `reject_closed_contract_reference` while ordinary executable sources can
  still be `accept_now`. `python scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json
  --fail-on-alert` exited zero.
- decision: closed contracts remain searchable evidence, but not executable
  work candidates.
- risk: high-signal worklogs can still appear as executable; next policy
  refinement should distinguish historical logs from explicit current TODOs.
- next: issue the next child-repo work packet only from a non-closed-contract
  source, starting with Hive worklog/gap cleanup if still top-ranked.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 23:59 KST — codex — ASC-0019 monitor assessment brain closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + implementation
- goal: convert monitor alerts into owner, severity, and next-action
  assessments for the control-plane operator loop.
- changed: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0019-monitor-assessment-brain.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py` passed. `python -m
  unittest tests/test_aios_monitor.py` passed 9/9. `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned `health=clear` with
  `continue_observing`. `python scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json
  --fail-on-alert` exited zero.
- decision: monitor assessment is recommendation-only. It may tell operators
  to collect results, run a watcher, hold, retry, or escalate; it does not
  execute that action by itself.
- risk: alert rules must remain conservative because they will steer future
  dispatch decisions.
- next: keep the sidecar running and use `assess` output before opening each
  new contract.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 00:10 KST — codex — ASC-0020 hive worklog gap cleanup closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + dispatch closeout
- goal: turn Hive worklog and gap-radar signals into one current executable
  Hive packet without re-opening closed work.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0020-hive-worklog-gap-cleanup.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, child gitlink for
  `hivemind`.
- evidence: `hivemind` committed `540ae37` (`Add radar gap triage`) with
  `docs/RADAR_GAP_TRIAGE.md` and `.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md`.
  `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_radar_review.py -v` passed 2/2.
  Operator spot-check confirmed `Selected Next Packet`, `Do Not Reopen`, and
  `ASC-0021` are present in `docs/RADAR_GAP_TRIAGE.md`. Dispatch result
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0020.hivemind.result.json` collected as
  `passed`, then released with reason `asc_0020_hive_gap_triage_verified`.
- decision: closed worklog signals remain evidence only. The next Hive
  implementation packet should be `ASC-0021 — Hive Arrival Pack`.
- risk: child watcher provider execution failed with access denied, so Codex
  completed the repo-local packet manually under contract scope and recorded
  the fallback in the result packet.
- next: open ASC-0021 for the Hive arrival-pack implementation.
- status: done

## 2026-05-11 22:35 KST — claude — Cross-workspace search + ASC-0008..0011 issued

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + research synthesis
- goal: per founder directive ("jaewon 아래 모든 docs를 search → 다음 작업
  추출 → contract 발행 → 그 행위 자체를 시스템에 이식, 절대 멈추지 마,
  모든 것을 활용해"), perform first cross-workspace search, synthesize
  findings, and issue the next-loop contracts the doc scout proposed.
- changed: `docs/discoveries/2026-05-11-jaewon-search.md` (new — synthesis of
  6 Explore agents + ASC-0007 scout output);
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0008-workspace-doc-ingest-memoryos.md` (new, accepted);
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0009-capability-observation-feedback.md` (new,
  accepted); `docs/contracts/ASC-0010-hive-semantic-quality-gate.md` (new,
  accepted); `docs/contracts/ASC-0011-control-plane-loop-policy.md` (new,
  accepted); `docs/contracts/README.md` (index extended); also commits Codex's
  ASC-0007 implementation (`scripts/aios_doc_scout.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_doc_scout.py`, `docs/AIOS_TASK_RADAR.md`,
  `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh` updates, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md` updates).
- evidence: 6 parallel Explore agents covered conscious_runtime+jarvis_AI,
  deepfake, universe quantum, docs+ablation+fire, graphRAG+GoEN, and
  dipeen+Uri+zeiint+competition. Codex's `aios_doc_scout.py` then scanned
  1822 docs, found signals in 1167, and auto-proposed
  ASC-0008/0009/0010/0011 with concrete slugs and goals matching the human
  synthesis. ASC-0007 verification gate ran clean (2 unittest pass +
  scout JSON output + radar markdown produced).
- decision: (1) ASC-0008 = MemoryOS ingest of radar signals (drafts only,
  no raw bodies, V1 scope = control-plane and OS-internal docs);
  (2) ASC-0009 = CapabilityOS observation feedback from result packets
  (recommendation-only invariant intact); (3) ASC-0010 = Hive semantic
  quality gate over radar candidates (advisory verdicts, no external LLM);
  (4) ASC-0011 = control-plane loop policy with capacity cap N=4 and
  privacy gating (`_from_desktop`/`dain`/`minyoung` paths NEVER auto-accept).
- risk: Codex is implementing in parallel — the ASC-0007 file shows status
  `accepted` here while the README index says `closed`. Resolved by the
  README being authoritative for status snapshots. The discoveries doc was
  also touched by Codex (scout output rerun with different counts) — both
  versions are valid snapshots of an evolving system.
- next: (1) commit this checkpoint; (2) wake child agents for ASC-0008
  (codex@memoryOS) and ASC-0010 (codex@hivemind) via aios_dispatch loop or
  child watcher; (3) continue cross-workspace search (Uri docs are high
  signal but founder-gated — surface as questions, not contracts);
  (4) when ASC-0008 lands, re-run scout; expect new candidates as the
  feedback loop closes.

## 2026-05-12 00:21 KST — codex — ASC-0021 Hive arrival pack closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: acting operator + supervisor
- goal: add a Hive-owned incoming-agent brief so child agents can wake with
  objective, blocked items, accepted/contested claims, scope hints, latest
  artifacts, and suggested commands without relying on chat context.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0021-hive-arrival-pack.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`; child repo commit
  `63ae099` changed `hivemind/arrival_pack.py`, `hivemind/hive.py`,
  `tests/test_arrival_pack.py`, `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and
  `.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md`.
- evidence: `python -m pytest tests/test_arrival_pack.py -v` passed 5/5;
  `python -m pytest tests/test_arrival_pack.py tests/test_inspect.py -v`
  passed 16/16; operational CLI smoke returned `kind=hive_arrival_pack` with
  paths hidden and no raw provider body fields; dispatch `asc-0021` collected
  and released.
- decision: ASC-0021 is closed. Future child-agent wake packets should prefer
  `hive arrival-pack --run <run_id> --json` over chat-relayed context when a
  Hive run exists.
- risk: initial child watcher implementation agents remain unreliable because
  the prior watcher provider call hit access denial; manual repo-local
  execution under dispatch scope remains the fallback until watcher execution
  is repaired.
- next: use the new arrival-pack surface in the next Hive child-agent packet,
  then decide whether ASC-0022 should target source-read registry or watcher
  execution reliability.

## 2026-05-12 01:31 KST — codex — ASC-0022 goal evolution loop closed

- repo: myworld

  recommendation with monitor, readiness, radar, and loop-policy evidence.

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0022-aios-goal-evolution-loop.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: goal evolution unit tests passed 4/4; JSON planner returned
  `schema_version=aios.goal_evolution.v1`; markdown planner wrote
  `docs/goals/AIOS-GOAL-0001-evolution.md`; dispatch `asc-0022` collected and
  released; monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: AIOS now has a goal-level recommendation loop. It is intentionally
  recommendation-only and does not auto-open contracts, dispatch child work, or
  accept private/archive paths.
- risk: the radar source still contains stale high-score worklog signals; the
  goal planner compensates by boosting explicit preferred-next signals while
  preserving loop-policy holds and closed-contract rejections.
- next: open the recommended Hive-owned source-read registry contract so
  future arrival packs can say which agents read which source artifacts and
  where divergent interpretations need reconciliation.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 02:11 KST — codex — ASC-0023 Hive source-read registry closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: acting operator + supervisor
- goal: add a Hive source-read registry so runs can record which agents read
  which source artifacts and expose divergent shared-source interpretations to
  incoming agents.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0023-hive-source-read-registry.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`; child repo commit
  `f96fd57` changed `hivemind/source_reads.py`, `hivemind/hive.py`,
  `hivemind/arrival_pack.py`, `tests/test_source_reads.py`, `docs/TODO.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and `.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md`.
- evidence: `python -m pytest tests/test_source_reads.py -v` passed 4/4;
  `python -m pytest tests/test_source_reads.py tests/test_arrival_pack.py -v`
  passed 9/9; operational CLI smoke wrote a source-read record and returned
  `schema_version=hive.source_reads.v1`; dispatch `asc-0023` collected and
  released; monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: source-read records are path/ref based and do not store raw source
  bodies. Arrival packs now include source-read summary plus reconciliation
  blockers when shared sources have divergent interpretations.
- risk: MemoryOS does not yet import these records as durable `SourceArtifact`
  nodes; that should be a later MemoryOS contract if the Hive artifact proves
  useful across several runs.
- next: rerun goal evolution. Likely next choices are watcher execution
  reliability or MemoryOS import of source-read provenance, depending on
  whether the goal prioritizes repeatability or context reuse.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 02:23 KST — codex — ASC-0024 goal planner source hygiene closed

- repo: myworld

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0024-goal-planner-source-hygiene.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: goal evolution tests passed 4/4; planner now blocks
  `AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and `AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md` with
  explicit history/index/reference reasons; after collect/release, monitor
  returned `health=clear` and the active recommendation became
  `goal:watcher_execution_reliability`.
- decision: history/reference documents are evidence surfaces, not direct
  implementation targets. Completed preferred item `source_read_registry` moved
  to goal completed progress.
- risk: `goal:*` recommendations still require a follow-up smart contract
  before implementation; they are not executable packets by themselves.
- next: open ASC-0025 for watcher execution reliability so implementation
  packets no longer require manual fallback after provider access-denied
  watcher failures.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 02:29 KST — codex — ASC-0025 child watcher provider fallback closed

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0025-child-watcher-provider-fallback.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: fake-provider tests passed 2/2; full myworld suite passed 37/37;
  `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed; dispatch watcher wrote a
  passed `asc-0025` result packet; collect and release succeeded; monitor
  returned `health=clear`.
- decision: the child watcher now classifies provider access/auth failures and
  may try exactly one alternate agent. Timeouts, missing commands, unsupported
  agents, and ordinary child-agent failures do not fallback.
- risk: fallback order is still static (`codex` <-> `claude`). A later
  CapabilityOS contract should use capability observations to choose provider
  routes instead of hard-coded alternates.
- next: rerun goal evolution. The expected next preferred item is
  `capability_routing_memory`.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 02:34 KST — codex — ASC-0026 capability observation-aware routing closed

  `capabilityos/catalog.py`, `capabilityos/cli.py`,
  `capabilityos/observation.py`, `tests/test_cli.py`,
  `tests/test_observation.py`).
- evidence: CapabilityOS tests passed 11/11; live
  `recommend --observations-inbox ../.aios/outbox` returned
  `observations_count=17`, `observed_capabilities=3`, and confidence/observed
  reason codes; audit preserved `execution_enabled=[]` and
  `recommendation_only=true`; dispatch `asc-0026` passed, collected, and
  released; monitor returned `health=clear`.
- decision: failed and timeout mapped result packets now count as observations
  and lower confidence through the bounded Beta rule. Skipped/unmapped packets
  remain review gaps and do not auto-create capabilities.
- risk: observations are still read in-memory from `.aios/outbox`; a future
  MemoryOS contract should decide which capability observations become durable
  accepted memory.
- next: rerun goal evolution. The expected next preferred item is
  `memory_feedback_tightening`.

## 2026-05-12 02:40 KST — codex — ASC-0027 memory feedback directives closed

  MemoryOS commit `06caf78`, and Hive commit `0d8557e`.
- evidence: MemoryOS focused context directive test passed; Hive focused
  memory bridge test passed; both ASC-0027 dispatch result packets were
  written, collected, and released; monitor returned `health=clear`.
- decision: directives are derived, privacy-safe context output. MemoryOS owns
  directive semantics; Hive only renders them and records
  `feedback_directives_count`.
- risk: child watcher provider fallback order is still static. The next
  improvement should bind CapabilityOS observation-aware recommendations into
  watcher/provider route choice.
- next: open `capability_route_binding` as the next goal-selected contract.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 03:04 KST — codex — ASC-0028 capability route binding closed

  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`, and
  CapabilityOS commit `80ab22a`.
- evidence: CapabilityOS provider-route tests passed 8/8; live provider-route
  smoke returned `capabilityos.provider_route.v1` with relative evidence refs;
  audit preserved `execution_enabled=[]`; myworld child watcher tests passed
  2/2; both ASC-0028 result packets were collected and released; monitor
  returned `health=clear`.
- decision: child watcher now asks CapabilityOS for a provider fallback route
  after access/auth-denied failures. If the route command is unavailable or
  invalid, it preserves ASC-0025 static fallback behavior.
- risk: there is still no persistent autonomous controller that opens the next
  contract after a chat turn ends; that is why the loop appears to stop after a
  final response.
- next: open `persistent_control_loop` to make continuation explicit and
  durable instead of depending on conversational turn lifetime.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 03:13 KST — codex — ASC-0029 persistent control loop closed

  wrote a durable `aios.round_controller.v1` receipt; ASC-0029 dispatch result
  packet passed, was collected, and was released; final monitor assessment
  returned `health=clear`.
- decision: the default persistent round is provider-independent and does not
  run child agents. Child execution requires explicit `--execute-children`.
- risk: the controller recommends the next contract but does not yet draft it
  automatically. That should be a follow-up contract if the goal continues to
  prioritize reduced relay.
- next: open `capability_observation_memory_import` so CapabilityOS result
  observations can become MemoryOS review candidates with provenance.

## 2026-05-12 03:27 KST — codex — ASC-0030 CapabilityOS web research route closed

  `recommend` ranked `cap_web_research_route` first for current internet/API
  doc research; `audit` reported `execution_enabled=[]` and
  `network_required=["cap_web_research_route"]`; ASC-0030 dispatch result was
  collected and released; final monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: CapabilityOS now plans broad web research but still does not open
  network connections. Actual web execution must happen in Hive/myworld tool
  runner under contract and return cited evidence.
- risk: web-derived facts are not yet imported into MemoryOS review lifecycle;
  they remain execution evidence until a MemoryOS contract handles durable
  memory import.
- next: open `capability_observation_memory_import` or
  `web_evidence_execution_loop`, depending on whether the next priority is
  storing capability observations or dogfooding the new web route.

## 2026-05-12 14:16 KST — codex — ASC-0031 web evidence execution loop closed

- evidence: web sources were gathered through the session web tool under the
  ASC-0030 route policy; receipt cites OpenAI web search docs, OpenAI Agents
  SDK tool docs, MCP official intro, and the MCP specification repository;
  `tests/test_aios_web_research_receipt.py` passed 5/5; receipt validation
  passed; full myworld suite passed 47/47; ASC-0031 dispatch result was
  collected and released; final monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: web research evidence is now a validated artifact type, not only a
  chat summary. CapabilityOS still routes; myworld/Hive execution produces
  evidence; MemoryOS review remains a future contract.
- risk: evidence is not yet transformed into MemoryOS source artifacts or
  reviewed memory drafts.
- next: create a governance/readiness contract for the expanded north star:
  AIOS as an accountable enterprise-scale and sovereign-AI operating system

  simulation readiness after ASC-0033 closeout, `sovereignty_claimed=false`,
  and `ready_for_real_world_authority=false`; ASC-0033 dispatch result was
  collected and released; final monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: AIOS can now measure institutional governance readiness above L6,
  but the model explicitly treats sovereignty as simulation/readiness, not
  real-world legal authority.
- risk: readiness is still descriptive/evaluative. The next step is an action
  policy engine that gates proposed AIOS actions by authority and risk class.

  result was collected and released; final monitor assessment returned

- decision: action policy is recommendation-only. It does not execute actions;
  it gives the control plane a pre-dispatch decision surface.

  produced `action_policy.decision=allow`, watcher result passed, collect and
  release completed; full myworld suite passed 59/59 in the watcher result;
  final monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: dispatch policy evaluation now runs before inbox delivery in both
  `aios_dispatch.py send` and `aios_loop.py once --apply`; blocked packets
  append `held`, `escalated`, or `stopped` evidence without writing an inbox
  packet.
- risk: the first dogfood dispatch `asc-0035` exposed a false positive where a
  verification file path containing `web` was read as an action signal. The
  matcher now uses phrase boundaries, and regression coverage prevents that
  path-token drift.
- next: open `cross_repo_semantic_alignment` so every lower-repo agent knows
  AIOS vocabulary, performs a meaning handshake before cross-repo work, and

  handshake validator passed; monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: every lower-repo AIOS agent now has a shared vocabulary contract
  and must checkpoint instead of silently translating ambiguous AIOS terms.
- risk: shared language prevents obvious drift, but it does not yet make
  working repos submit goals back to myworld automatically.

  Korean-locale classifier regression; full myworld suite passed; `asc-0037`
  was released with reason `asc_0037_locale_aware_fallback_verified`; monitor
  assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: localized provider auth/access failures are part of watcher
  reliability, not ordinary child-agent implementation failure.
- risk: future provider CLIs may emit new localized auth strings; those should
  become targeted classifier tests, not broad catch-all regexes.

  `run_20260512_171540_45136a`; result packets passed for myworld, hivemind,
  memoryOS, and CapabilityOS; lower-repo commits `hivemind@33fdc56`,
  `memoryOS@457bbf2`, `memoryOS@9f8b8bb`, and `CapabilityOS@ff25f5c`; full
  myworld suite passed 69/69; final monitor assessment returned
  `health=clear`.
- decision: self-resonance now has an executable local protocol:
  `aios_repo_goal.py submit` creates `aios.repo_goal.v1`, `route` creates
  `aios.repo_goal_route.v1`, and lower repos are instructed to use it for
  AIOS-relevant goals, blockers, observations, and friction.
- risk: this is still file/CLI protocol, not the visualization-first app. The
  route packet recommends the next smart contract; it does not dispatch or
  execute automatically.
- next: open `visual_control_application` as the next goal-preferred contract,
  with `on_prem_evolving_application` as the packaging track behind it.

## 2026-05-12 18:24 KST — codex — ASC-0039 visual control application closed

- repo: myworld

  `cap_capabilityos_recommendation`, `cap_memoryos_context_build`,
  `cap_hivemind_execution_harness`, and `cap_memoryos_import_run`; Hive dry-run
  `run_20260512_181228_aef902`; `asc-0039` result packet
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0039.myworld.result.json`; snapshot reports 39
  contracts, 33 dispatches, and monitor `clear`; full tests passed 72/72.
- decision: the control app starts as a dependency-free local static surface
  backed by `aios.control_snapshot.v1`. It visualizes the loop without
  becoming a child-repo worker or adding a packaging framework yet.
- risk: this is a static snapshot app, not yet a packaged on-prem daemon or
  live updating application.
- next: open `on_prem_evolving_application` to package the control plane,
  snapshot refresh, round controller, and local app launch into one repeatable
  command.

## 2026-05-12 18:35 KST — codex — ASC-0040 on-prem evolving application closed

  running at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`.
- decision: AIOS now has a local app command surface:
  `python scripts/aios_local_app.py up|refresh|status|start|stop --json`.
  This packages the visual control app without moving implementation ownership
  out of child repos.
- risk: this is still a lightweight local wrapper around scripts and a static
  server, not a full installer, service manager, or desktop application.
- next: open `web_evidence_memory_review` so validated web evidence can become
  MemoryOS review candidates without auto-accepting external facts.

## 2026-05-12 KST — claude — Uri personal agent loop pivot reviewed + AIOS routing surfaced

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: product narrative + control-plane surface
- goal: review `codex@uri`'s in-flight Uri pivot to a personal-agent-loop wedge,
  capture the founder's 2026-05-12 directive that Uri development must route
  through AIOS (Hive / Memory / Capability), and surface remaining policy gaps
  and one routing tension to the operator pair.
- changed: `uri/CLAUDE.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-personal-agent-loop-claude-review.md`,
  `uri/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `myworld/docs/discoveries/2026-05-12-uri-personal-agent-pivot.md`,
  `myworld/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`. Did not edit codex's existing pivot
  docs or drafts inside `uri/`.
- evidence: `uri/docs/URI_PERSONAL_AGENT_LOOP.md` (codex's seven-step pivot
  doc), already-updated `uri/docs/URI_NORTHSTAR.md` (temporal-moat thesis),
  `uri/docs/PRODUCT_BRIEF.md` (wedge order now personal-loop-first), and
  `uri/docs/MEMORY_POLICY.md` (Self-Ingest Policy section already added by
  codex); `uri/hive/packets/URI-002-sprint-001-web-prototype.md` authorizing
  "Next.js App Router web app in the Uri repo" with Sprint 001 `in_progress`;
  founder directive 2026-05-12 KST.
- decision: hold three items for operator decision in a single follow-on
  Uri ASC — (a) `avatar` operational definition for MemoryOS / CapabilityOS
  routing; (b) self-ingest consent surface (per-source granularity,
  revocation path, visibility split); (c) Sprint 002+ routing — whether
  subsequent execution stays in `uri/` (treating `uri/hive/packets/` as the
  durable hive layer) or moves to `hivemind/` via MyWorld dispatch.
  Sprint 001 should reach its existing verification gate first so the
  contract points at a working artifact.
- risk: Sprint 001 implementing inside `uri/` is in tension with the founder's
  "무조건 AIOS 통해" directive. Resolving without an ASC would either stall
  the in-flight Next.js scaffold or silently entrench a non-AIOS execution
  path. Also, the 2026-05-11 jaewon-search discovery still classifies Uri as
  a non-absorption reference project — twice superseded, needs an annotation
  entry once the follow-on ASC opens.
- next: operator pair drafts the post-ASC-0032 Uri contract per
  `docs/discoveries/2026-05-12-uri-personal-agent-pivot.md` (work packets
  WP-A through WP-E sketched there).
- status: open

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri Kakao map provider gap surfaced

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: implementation + capability feedback
- goal: inspect prior `uri-v2` KakaoMap-based `/u/[schoolSlug]` work and keep
  Uri's current campus app moving toward real-map + Uri-owned overlay
  architecture.
- changed: `uri/hive/packets/URI-004-sprint-003-kakao-map-provider.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-kakao-map-provider.md`,
  `uri/capabilities/kakao-map-provider-routing-2026-05-12.md`, and this
  ledger entry.
- evidence: GitHub `cjw0076/uri-v2` visible branches do not contain the Kakao
  campus map source; local `_from_desktop/uri-v2` has a broken `HEAD`, while
  `.next` chunks confirm a Kakao Maps loader, `CustomOverlay` place/spot
  overlays, Roadview, campus bbox/polygon constraints, and Supabase realtime
  bubbles. The supplied `3a69...` value is not a Git commit and appears to be
  a public Kakao JS key in compiled local chunks.
- capability gap: CapabilityOS needs a durable "provider + fallback + visual
  verification" contract for external services. A child repo should be able to
  add a provider route without blocking local development on credentials, while
  still recording exact env requirements and verification limits.
- decision: real map APIs are infrastructure; Uri's owned value is the
  campus memory graph, cells, traces, experiences, and agent state overlays.
- status: open

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri campus graph platform primitive added

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: implementation + capability feedback
- goal: pause map work and continue Uri toward app + platform by adding a
  local campus graph primitive.
- changed: `uri/hive/packets/URI-005-sprint-004-campus-graph-platform.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-campus-graph-platform.md`,
  `uri/capabilities/campus-graph-platform-routing-2026-05-12.md`, and this
  ledger entry.
- evidence: Uri now derives `place`, `trace`, `memory`, and `experience` graph
  nodes from local app state and exposes `/u/[schoolSlug]/graph`; typecheck,
  build, and Playwright mobile/desktop visual checks passed.
- capability gap: CapabilityOS should recommend "pure local contract first"
  when a working repo evolves from app surface to platform substrate, so DB,
  provider, and MemoryOS persistence choices do not harden before the domain
  graph is clear.
- decision: one campus should become one shared graph substrate, while each
  user owns a private lens over traces, memory candidates, and agent recall.
- status: open

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri AIOS-routed department layer + workflow friction

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: implementation + AIOS dogfood feedback
- goal: continue Uri development as the priority while using AIOS repo-goal
  intake to surface both product goals and AIOS workflow friction.
- AIOS intake:
  - `.aios/goal_inbox/uri/rg_20260512T231440_275ad0cbe16f.json`
  - `.aios/goal_inbox/uri/rg_20260512T231440_48e8f936dd28.json`
  - `.aios/goal_inbox/uri/rg_20260512T231440_d7ef0e2827d5.json`
  - matching route packets under `.aios/goal_routes/uri/`
- changed: `uri/hive/packets/URI-006-sprint-005-department-contribution.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-department-contribution-layer.md`,
  `uri/capabilities/department-contribution-routing-2026-05-12.md`, and this
  ledger entry.
- evidence: Uri now has `/u/[schoolSlug]/dept`; selected department is stored
  in local profile, campus traces and connect experience entries inherit
  `departmentId`, and visual/mobile checks passed.
- feedback: `scripts/aios_repo_goal.py` is useful but remains a primitive.
  Codex still manually performs goal interpretation, memory/capability/hive
  artifact writing, universe choice, chair decision, implementation,
  verification, and ledger learning. AIOS needs a product-repo sprint driver
  that does this as one operator-facing action.
- decision: department contribution is the next platform layer because it
  aggregates personal loops into a campus-local signal without touching private
  self-ingest sources.
- status: open

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri avatar surface + research-to-sprint gap

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: implementation + web research + AIOS capability feedback
- goal: continue Uri product execution while using public web sources to grow
  strategic context and feeding AIOS workflow gaps back upward.
- changed: `uri/hive/packets/URI-007-sprint-006-avatar-agent-surface.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-avatar-agent-surface.md`,
  `uri/capabilities/avatar-agent-surface-routing-2026-05-12.md`,
  `uri/research/public-sources/uri-aios-growth-intel-2026-05-12.md`, and this
  ledger entry.
- evidence: public-source scan covered Ready Education, Pathify, Suitable,
  Nearpeer, Google NotebookLM/Classroom updates, and Kakao Maps Web API; Uri
  `/me` now exposes avatar profile, department, graph readiness, and agent
  action cards; typecheck/build/browser checks passed.
- capability gaps:
  - Add `research_to_sprint_context`: user direction -> source scan -> clean
    notes -> memory candidate -> capability gap -> hive sprint context.
  - Add `agent_surface_before_agent_execution`: local graph summary -> allowed
    action list -> LLM/tool routing later.
- decision: Uri should not add AI chat before the deterministic avatar/graph
  surface makes clear what the agent can know and do.
- status: open

## 2026-05-12 18:55 KST — codex — ASC-0041 web evidence memory review closed

  passed; MemoryOS `import-run --dry-run --json` planned three draft memory
  objects with raw refs suppressed; full myworld suite passed 79/79; final
  monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: web-derived public evidence now enters AIOS as review candidates
  only: `auto_accept=false`, `status=draft`,
  `evidence_state=unreviewed`, and source provenance must resolve back to the
  validated receipt. Dispatch policy was tightened so local evidence-review
  contracts are not escalated merely because their docs contain `web`,
  `public`, or forbidden private-data guardrail text.
- risk: candidates are not accepted MemoryOS objects yet; the next contract
  should decide which CapabilityOS observations become reviewable MemoryOS
  memory and keep the same no-auto-accept rule.
- next: open `capability_observation_memory_import`.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 19:08 KST — codex — ASC-0042 capability observation memory import closed

  result packet `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0042.myworld.result.json`;
  candidate validator passed; MemoryOS `import-run --dry-run --json` planned
  three draft memory objects; full myworld suite passed 83/83; final monitor
  assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: capability observations enter MemoryOS as capability-level rollup
  review candidates, not per-event memory spam and not accepted routing truth.
  Gaps such as unmapped `myworld` results remain `operator_review_only`.
- risk: the next missing layer is automatic contract drafting from goal
  evolution. Until that exists, Codex still translates the recommendation into
  a contract manually.
- next: open `contract_autodraft_from_goal_plan`.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 19:17 KST — codex — ASC-0043 contract autodraft from goal plan closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + control-plane implementation

  contract draft without relying on chat memory.
- changed: `scripts/aios_contract_autodraft.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0043-contract-autodraft-from-goal-plan.md`,

  `cap_web_research_route`; Hive dry-run `run_20260512_190848_7a86e2`;
  autodraft command wrote the initial ASC-0043 proposed contract; result packet
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0043.myworld.result.json`; focused tests passed
  3/3; full myworld suite passed 86/86; final monitor assessment returned
  `health=clear`.
- decision: goal evolution can now produce proposed contracts directly, but
  cannot accept, dispatch, or close them. Blocked recommendations or plans with
  stop conditions are refused.
- risk: the first watcher attempt exposed a test dependency on live monitor
  state during active dispatch. The test now uses a precomputed plan JSON so
  verification does not fail merely because the contract being verified is in
  progress.
- next: use autodraft output to open the next radar/policy candidate, currently
  a Hive Mind radar-gap triage packet.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 19:31 KST — codex — ASC-0044 desktop control application closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting operator + control-plane implementation

  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0044-desktop-control-application.md`,

  `uses_http_server=false`, and `uses_browser=false`; full myworld suite passed
  90/90; final monitor assessment returned `health=clear`.
- decision: AIOS now has a native desktop path:
  `python scripts/aios_desktop_app.py launch`. Headless verification uses
  `status` and `snapshot` because `$DISPLAY` is not available in this shell.
- risk: this is a lightweight tkinter desktop shell, not yet a packaged
  installer or signed desktop app.
- next: package or harden the desktop app only after the native surface proves
  useful; otherwise continue with the Hive radar-gap triage candidate.

## 2026-05-12 20:31 KST — codex — ASC-0045 Hive HANDOFF compat import closed

  `docs/HANDOFF.json` produced `run_20260512_202643_5921bf` and inspect
  returned `status=imported`, `validation_verdict=pass`, `verdict=clean`.
- decision: legacy shared-folder handoff state can now enter Hive as a standard
  run artifact through `hive handoff import`, while preserving the no raw-body
  and no MemoryOS acceptance boundary.
- risk: imported runs are replay/inspection artifacts, not execution decisions;
  ledger/protocol authority remains separate and may still report missing
  execution ledger on legacy imports.
- next: open the next Hive verification packet, likely first-class
  `hive evaluate` / `hive subagents review`, unless goal evolution selects a
  higher-value unblocked candidate.

## 2026-05-12 20:40 KST — codex — ASC-0046 concrete Hive TODO refinement closed

  recommends `myworld/hivemind/docs/TODO.md#hive-evaluate` with task
  `Add first-class hive evaluate or hive subagents review...`; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 91/91; `git diff --check` passed.
- decision: the control plane may keep using `RADAR_GAP_TRIAGE.md` as evidence,
  but actionable recommendations should resolve to concrete unchecked child
  TODO anchors when a known refinement exists.
- risk: this is a targeted refinement for the Hive radar-gap source, not a
  general markdown TODO parser for every repo.

- decision: Hive now has a deterministic, provider-free evaluation surface:
  `hive evaluate --run <run_id>` and `hive subagents review --run <run_id>`.
  It writes `artifacts/evaluation_report.json`, updates run state, and keeps
  raw provider/private bodies out of the report.
- risk: this is a structured review over existing inspect/validation signals,
  not yet true independent LLM subagent execution.

  recommendation into another concrete TODO or move to the highest-value
  MemoryOS/CapabilityOS held candidate.

  generated plan now recommends
  `myworld/hivemind/docs/TODO.md#semantic-verifier`; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 92/92; `git diff --check` passed.
- decision: Hive radar TODO refinement now normalizes pattern phrases and TODO
  text the same way, so hyphenated wording such as `high-risk` does not cause
  a broad-source repeat.
- risk: this still uses a small explicit Hive radar refinement table; a more
  general TODO extractor may be needed once other repos need the same behavior.
- next: issue the concrete Hive semantic-verifier contract if the monitor
  remains clear.

## 2026-05-12 22:59 KST — codex — ASC-0049 Hive semantic verifier review closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: acting operator + child-repo implementation
- goal: add a Hive semantic verifier review surface for high-risk runs without
  automatic provider execution.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0049-hive-semantic-verifier-review.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/goals/AIOS-GOAL-0001-evolution.md`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/semantic_verifier.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/evaluation.py`, `hivemind/hivemind/hive.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/run_validation.py`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_semantic_verifier.py`, `hivemind/docs/TODO.md`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and
  `hivemind/.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md`.
- evidence: MemoryOS trace `rtrace_ee519c13d4b1b75a`; CapabilityOS top route
  `cap_hivemind_execution_harness`; Hive dry-run
  `run_20260512_224741_56e342`; hivemind commit `a0df4ca`; result packet
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0049.hivemind.result.json`; focused tests passed
  6/6 and 12/12; CLI smoke returned `kind=hive_semantic_verification`,
  `status=review_required`, `risk_level=high`, and
  `provider_executed=false`; full Hive pytest passed 322/322.
- decision: `hive semantic-review` prepares semantic verifier review evidence
  and a redacted LLM prompt, but it does not auto-run provider CLIs or local
  LLMs. `hive evaluate` now blocks high-risk runs that lack semantic review and
  cites the review once present.
- risk: this is prepared verifier evidence, not an independent executed LLM
  judgment. Provider execution should be a separate policy-gated contract.
- next: resolve the remaining broad Hive radar recommendation or move to the
  next concrete non-Hive candidate.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 23:18 KST — claude+codex — ASC-0050 AIOS primitive surface closed

- repo: myworld
- role: operator primitive formalization + compatibility hardening
- goal: reverse-engineer the Claude CLI operator primitive set into an
  AIOS-owned surface that Codex and local LLM workers can call without
  depending on Claude or Codex chat runtimes.
- changed: `scripts/aios_primitives.py`, `scripts/aios_primitives/`,
  `tests/test_aios_primitives.py`, `docs/AIOS_PRIMITIVES.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0050-aios-primitive-surface.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and result packet
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0050.myworld.result.json`.
- evidence: myworld commit `dcfae42`; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_primitives.py scripts/aios_primitives/*.py` passed; focused
  primitive tests passed 24/24; tools discovery smoke found the
  CapabilityOS web route; web receipt smoke wrote
  `aios.web_research_receipt.v1`; monitor start/list/stop smoke passed; task
  create/list smoke passed; full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed
  116/116.
- decision: AIOS primitives are coordination primitives, not unrestricted
  execution powers. Agent sync execution and skill binding remain explicit
  future contracts so the system absorbs CLI semantics without bypassing Hive,
  MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, or operator policy.
- risk: `web fetch` currently stores cited receipt metadata rather than
  fetching raw page bodies, and child repos still need adapters to call this
  surface from their local working directories.
- next: release `asc-0050`, assess the monitor, then draft the next
  AIOS-native runtime contract so the lasting interface is AIOS itself rather
  than Claude CLI or Codex CLI.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 23:35 KST — codex — ASC-0051 co-evolution heartbeat closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + verification
- goal: use the ASC-0050 primitive monitor surface to arm MemoryOS,
  CapabilityOS, and Hive co-evolution pulse loops without relying on chat
  continuation.
- changed: `scripts/aios_coevolution/`, `tests/test_aios_coevolution.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_COEVOLUTION.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0051-aios-coevolution-heartbeat.md`, and
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_coevolution.py` passed 3/3;
  standalone `memory_pulse.sh`, `capability_pulse.sh`, and `hive_pulse.sh`
  each exited 0; dogfood `arm.sh -> status.py --json -> stop.sh` produced one
  event for each pulse and left all three monitors `alive=false`; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 120/120.
- decision: pulse scripts are one-pass sensors/recommenders; the primitive
  monitor owns persistence. Memory ingest writes only under
  `.aios/primitives/coevolution/memory_root`, CapabilityOS remains
  recommendation-only, and Hive pulse does not dispatch.
- risk: the live pulse currently writes local runtime state under `.aios/` and
  should not be committed; memory pulse reported four importer warnings during
  dogfood and those should be reviewed before long unattended runs.
- next: close or implement ASC-0052 so the user-facing control surface becomes
  `aios_runtime` rather than Claude/Codex CLI orchestration.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 23:44 KST — codex — ASC-0052 AIOS native runtime entrypoint closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation
- goal: make AIOS itself the user-facing command surface instead of Claude CLI
  or Codex CLI orchestration.
- changed: `scripts/aios_runtime.py`, `tests/test_aios_runtime.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_RUNTIME.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0052-aios-native-runtime-entrypoint.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and result packet
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0052.myworld.result.json`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_runtime.py` passed; focused
  runtime tests passed 5/5; `status --json`, `step --json`, and bounded
  `run --max-rounds 1 --interval-seconds 0 --json` returned stable runtime
  schemas; `step` emitted `aios.runtime.step`; full myworld `test_aios_*.py`
  suite passed 125/125.
- decision: `aios_runtime.py` is the first AIOS-native interface. Claude,
  Codex, and provider CLIs remain execution substrates behind status, step,
  run, and submit-goal.
- risk: this is an entrypoint, not the final visual control application or a
  full natural-language chair. It still delegates to existing scripts and
  reports monitor blocks instead of hiding them.
- next: use `python scripts/aios_runtime.py status|step|run` as the default
  operator surface, then evolve a richer chair/visual runtime on top of it.
- status: done

## 2026-05-12 KST — claude — Uri /loop iter 1 wrap + codex auto-chair collision noted

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: product narrative + control-plane surface, /loop iteration 1 wrap
- goal: close iter 1 of claude@uri's /loop dynamic mode. In the same window
  codex@uri's auto-chair shipped Sprint 005 (department contribution) and
  Sprint 006 (avatar agent surface + growth-intel research) and
  self-submitted 5 goal-inbox packets, while claude@uri staged Sprint 005
  /me scope and iter-1 memory growth. Packet IDs collided (URI-006/URI-007)
  and the /me scope partially overlapped — codex covered graph readiness +
  partial agent intro; three gap cards remain. Reconcile and refocus
  claude@uri's lane.
- changed: `uri/hive/packets/URI-008-sprint-007-claude-followup-after-avatar.md`
  (Sprint 006 review + Sprint 007 gap scope; replaces the staged-but-removed
  `URI-007-sprint-006-me-agent-surface.md`),
  `uri/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `myworld/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`. Iter-1 deliverables already on disk:
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-korean-univ-cohort.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-competitive-pathify-cxp.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-me-agent-surface.md`,
  `uri/capabilities/me-agent-surface-routing-2026-05-12.md`,
  `myworld/docs/discoveries/2026-05-12-uri-growth-loop.md`.
- evidence: codex worklog 2026-05-12 KST entries for Sprint 005 and Sprint
  006 (the latter with `AIOS intake: 5 goal-inbox packets, 5 route packets`);
  `uri/.runs/visual-check/me-avatar-desktop.png` confirming /me now has
  Avatar surface + `agent ready 75%` pill + two CTAs;
  `uri/hive/packets/URI-006-sprint-005-department-contribution.md` and
  `uri/hive/packets/URI-007-sprint-006-avatar-agent-surface.md`;
  myworld ledger ASC-0033 → ASC-0050 closed in the same window (notably
  ASC-0038 self-resonant repo loop, ASC-0044 desktop control app,
  ASC-0050 AIOS primitive surface). Public-source WebSearch on Korean
  university enrollment (Statista / MoE / Korea Herald) and Pathify CXP
  (PRNewswire / EDUCAUSE / E&I / PitchBook).
- decision: claude@uri /loop iter pacing — emit ScheduleWakeup ~1500s after
  each iter behind the polling monitor; do not race codex's chair on
  sprint scope authoring. Future claude scope submissions go through
  `.aios/goal_inbox/uri/` per ASC-0038, not directly into `hive/packets/`.
  Lane refocus: review-after-the-fact + abstract research/policy + memory
  growth + stop-conditions for next sprint.
- risk: codex@uri's auto-chair currently consumes goal-inbox packets, not
  packets written by claude@uri directly into `hive/packets/`. URI-008 is
  human-readable scope today; iter 2 should also submit it to
  `.aios/goal_inbox/uri/` if Sprint 007's three gap cards remain open.
  This is an operator-checkpoint candidate: the chair pipeline should
  also accept claude-authored hive packets as candidates.
- next: /loop iter 2 — review codex's next sprint result as it lands;
  user-test new screenshots; submit Sprint 007 scope via goal-inbox if
  still open; grow memory with one more competitor (Ready Education or
  Notion for Education) and one freemium economics note.
- status: open

## 2026-05-12 KST — codex — Uri Sprint 007 provider-loop observation sent

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: Codex implementation provider reporting AIOS operating friction
- goal: pass the operator observation upward, then continue Uri product
  development rather than stopping at process analysis.
- observation: Codex CLI is effective for code edits, tests, browser checks,
  and structured artifacts, but it is not yet the durable monitoring/product
  sprint loop. AIOS should own the user-facing loop and treat Codex, Claude,
  Hive, browser verification, and scripts as provider primitives.
- changed in uri: Sprint 007 `/me` agent guidance surface adds next entry
  recommendation, reflection candidates, and self-ingest preview chips; added
  `uri/hive/packets/URI-009-sprint-007-agent-guidance-surface.md`,
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-12-agent-guidance-surface.md`, and
  `uri/capabilities/agent-guidance-surface-routing-2026-05-12.md`.
- AIOS intake: submitted observation packet
  `.aios/goal_inbox/uri/rg_20260512T235155_fbce5ac1c64a.json` and route packet
  `.aios/goal_routes/uri/route_rg_20260512T235155_fbce5ac1c64a_fbce5ac1c64a.json`.
- risk: current repo-goal route remains recommendation-only; the missing piece
  is a provider-agnostic product sprint loop runner that can execute, verify,
  and feed learnings back without manual Codex chat bridging.
- status: in_progress

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0053 Hive provider-loop runner closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: acting AIOS operator and Hive implementation provider
- goal: absorb Claude monitor-style plans, Codex one-shot ticks, and local LLM
  worker ticks into a Hive-owned provider-loop artifact surface.
- changed: `hivemind/hivemind/provider_loop.py`, `hivemind/hivemind/hive.py`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_provider_loop.py`, Hive TODO/worklogs, and
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0053-hive-provider-loop-runner.md`.
- evidence: Hive commit `89458d7`; result packet
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0053.hivemind.result.json`; focused
  provider-loop tests passed 7/7; provider-loop + passthrough + supervisor
  suite passed 23/23; CLI smoke wrote one Codex worker with
  `loop_mode=one_shot_tick`; full Hive suite passed 329/329.
- decision: AIOS should expose providers through Hive loop receipts, not rely
  on direct Claude/Codex chat prompting as the operating interface.
- next: create a thin global `aios` launcher that resolves the current
  workspace control plane, then calls `scripts/aios_runtime.py` and Hive
  `provider-loop` surfaces.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0054 global AIOS launcher closed

- repo: myworld
- role: acting AIOS operator and control-plane implementer
- goal: make AIOS reachable as a command surface without moving state out of
  the selected MyWorld control-plane root.
- changed: `bin/aios`, `scripts/aios_launcher.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_launcher.py`, `docs/AIOS_RUNTIME.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`, and
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0054-global-aios-launcher.md`.
- evidence: launcher tests passed 6/6; `bin/aios --root . root --json`
  returned `aios.launcher.v1`; `bin/aios --root . status --json` returned
  `aios.runtime.status.v1`; `bin/aios --root . provider-loop status --json`
  returned `hive.provider_loop.v1`; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 131/131;
  monitor health was clear.
- decision: AIOS should be globally reachable but workspace-local in state.
  The global command is a locator/delegator, not a second control plane.
- next: build the richer AIOS chair command that turns one natural-language
  goal into MemoryOS context, CapabilityOS route, Hive provider-loop plan,
  verification, and learning receipt.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0055 Ollama Qwen provider absorption closed

- repo: myworld + CapabilityOS + hivemind
- role: acting AIOS operator, capability implementer, and Hive worker-spec
  implementer
- goal: demonstrate how AIOS absorbs a new local LLM/provider without binding
  execution.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_PROVIDER_ABSORPTION.md`,
  `CapabilityOS/capabilityos/catalog.py`,
  `CapabilityOS/tests/fixtures/capabilities.json`,
  `CapabilityOS/tests/test_cli.py`, `hivemind/hivemind/local_workers.py`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_local_worker_routing.py`, and
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0055-absorb-ollama-qwen25-7b.md`.
- evidence: CapabilityOS commit `653e2ef`; Hive commit `56ae4e7`;
  `cap_ollama_qwen25_7b_local` ranked #1 for "private local LLM with tool
  use"; audit stayed `recommendation_only=true` with `execution_enabled=[]`;
  Hive declared `ollama_qwen25_7b` without invoking Ollama; CapabilityOS tests
  passed 16/16; Hive local worker tests passed 5/5; MyWorld AIOS tests passed
  131/131; capability pulse completed with `audit_status=ok`.
- decision: provider absorption is a six-stage recipe: evidence, local
  registry, CapabilityOS card, Hive worker spec, observation collection, then
  MemoryOS draft review. Execution binding remains a separate contract.
- policy note: action policy escalated dispatch send for external-effect
  checkpoint. Acting operator proceeded because this slice is declaration-only
  and recommendation-only.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — claude — Uri /loop iter 5 binds founder loop hypothesis to ASC-0053/0054/0055

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: founder hypothesis intake + cross-OS evidence binding
- goal: founder articulated "local sprint file + AIOS runner + Codex one-shot
  worker = loop" on 2026-05-13 KST during /loop dynamic mode and quoted
  codex@uri on the execution-primitive gap. Confirm against uri's Sprint
  001–008 evidence and bind to ASC-0053 (Hive provider-loop runner), ASC-0054
  (global aios launcher), ASC-0055 (Ollama Qwen provider absorption) — all
  already closed on 2026-05-13 covering the same mechanism.
- changed: `myworld/docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-codex-sprint-file-loop-pattern.md`
  (new), `myworld/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `uri/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: uri Sprint 001 → 008 visible across `uri/hive/packets/URI-002`
  through `URI-010` + `.runs/visual-check/me-agent-guidance-*.png`;
  codex@uri's own provider-loop-friction observation in ledger lines
  1900–1921 (Sprint 007 entry); ASC-0053 closed by codex@myworld on
  2026-05-13 with `hivemind/hivemind/provider_loop.py` absorbing Claude
  monitor-style plans + Codex one-shot ticks + local LLM worker ticks
  (commit `89458d7`); ASC-0054 added `bin/aios` global launcher with
  `provider-loop status --json`; ASC-0055 demonstrated provider-absorption
  six-stage recipe with `cap_ollama_qwen25_7b_local`.
- decision: founder hypothesis matches Uri's observed pattern AND matches
  ASC-0053's design intent. Sprint-file loop pattern is **already** the
  AIOS-native primitive — Uri is its first child-repo instance. Three
  earlier-drafted candidate ASCs (writable provider sandbox / Claude
  non-interactive stabilization / sprint-file primitive formalization) are
  all subsumed by ASC-0053. Only open recommendation is **receipt
  visibility for claude@uri's iteration cycle** — claude@uri does not
  currently emit `.aios/outbox/uri/` receipts the way codex@uri does for
  goal-inbox intake.
- risk: control-plane visibility gap on claude@uri side — drafts and review
  packets land in the repo but are invisible to `bin/aios provider-loop
  status` until they trigger a codex pickup. Mitigation in next bullet.
- next: claude@uri /loop iter 6+ — emit `.aios/outbox/uri/claude.<iter>.result.json`
  after each iter (schema candidate: `aios.claude_iter.v1` with `iter_id`,
  `evidence_paths`, `packets_authored`, `memory_drafts`, `recommendations`,
  `next_iter_plan`). Operator pair may later decide whether to merge into
  Hive `hive.provider_loop.v1` schema or keep as a sibling artifact.
- status: open

## 2026-05-13 KST — claude — Uri /loop iter 6: first receipt + provider-loop Sprint 008 failure observed

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: claude@uri /loop iteration 6 + control-plane visibility bridge
- goal: per iter 5 decision, start emitting `claude@uri` receipts and exercise
  `bin/aios provider-loop status`. Observed: ASC-0053 provider-loop ran 2
  workers for Uri Sprint 008 — both stopped/failed on first tick. Bind
  observation to the existing discovery and surface as operator-checkpoint.
- changed: `uri/.aios/outbox/uri/claude.6.result.json` (first receipt;
  schema `aios.claude_iter.v1`),
  `uri/memory/drafts/2026-05-13-competitive-notion-for-education.md`,
  `myworld/docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-codex-sprint-file-loop-pattern.md`
  (provider-loop fail evidence appended),
  `myworld/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`,
  `uri/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: `bin/aios --root /home/user/workspaces/jaewon/myworld provider-loop
  status --json` returned `count=2`. **codex worker** `ploop_ce1a3a94310aa3dc`
  `loop_mode=one_shot_tick`, `tick_count=1`, `status=stopped`,
  `last_status=completed`, prompt cites `uri/hive/packets/URI-010` — so
  claude@uri's review packet DID reach the provider-loop. **claude worker**
  `ploop_0992ac5f5e38265d` `loop_mode=monitor_plan`, `tick_count=1`,
  `status=active`, `last_status=failed`, prompt cites "after Codex provider
  sandbox failure." Sprint 008 has 4 work packages; one-tick limit is
  insufficient for the codex worker, and the claude fallback failed on its
  first attempt. dev-shell remains the only producing path so far.
- decision: ASC-0053's primitive layer is working (receipts, prompts,
  schemas). The execution layer needs tuning — `loop_mode=multi_tick` or
  `until_done` for sprint-sized work; diagnosis of `claude monitor_plan`
  failure; receipt/dev-shell reconciliation. Operator-checkpoint candidates
  documented in the discovery's "iter 6 update."
- risk: if Sprint 008 ships only via dev-shell, the AIOS-native promise
  weakens for any future operator who doesn't have direct dev-shell access.
  The provider-loop must complete at least one Uri sprint end-to-end before
  the loop pattern can be claimed as the durable AIOS surface.
- next: claude@uri iter 7+ — keep emitting receipts; grow memory with
  MemoryOS provenance schema sketch; user-test Sprint 008 dev-shell result
  if it lands; await operator triage of the provider-loop tuning items
  before relying on it for Sprint 009+.
- status: open

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0062 peer-share privacy projection closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + verification
- goal: close the first Sovereign Swarm layer by defining what can leave a
  local AIOS instance before peer identity, share repo, remote sync, or raw
  memory federation exists.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_SWARM_NORTHSTAR.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_SHARE_INVARIANTS.md`,
  `scripts/aios_share_projection.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_share_projection.py`,
  `tests/fixtures/share_projection/*.json`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0062-peer-share-privacy-projection.md`, and
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: valid capability observation projection passed; raw memory and
  hard-ban secret-path fixtures were blocked; share projection validator
  reports no network, git sync, memory acceptance, or provider execution;
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 142/142;
  `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned `health=clear`.
- decision: peer-share work remains local projection only. ASC-0063 may cover
  peer identity later, but it requires a separate founder GO and must not
  inherit authority from ASC-0062.
- note: Codex CLI has no native indefinite loop command in `codex-cli 0.130.0`;
  it provides `exec`, `exec resume`, app/remote servers, and JSON events.
  AIOS should keep owning the loop and treat Codex as a bounded provider.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0076/0078 reconciliation and work visibility closed

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: restore sprint order after accepted-but-unclosed contracts accumulated,
  and make current AIOS work visible to the operator without exposing raw
  provider output or private files.
- changed: `scripts/aios_contract_reconcile.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_contract_reconcile.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTRACT_RECONCILIATION.md`,
  `scripts/aios_work_view.py`, `tests/test_aios_work_view.py`,

  tests/test_aios_contract_reconcile.py tests/test_aios_work_view.py
  tests/test_aios_invoke.py -v` passed 15/15; `python
  scripts/aios_contract_reconcile.py --from 56 --to 68 --write
  docs/AIOS_CONTRACT_RECONCILIATION.md --json` produced next_contract
  `ASC-0066`; `python scripts/aios_work_view.py status` showed active
  contracts, blocked dispatches, changed files, and next actions; `python -m
  unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 164/164; `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0076 is closed with an auditable matrix. ASC-0078 is closed
  with a read-only work view. The next sprint target remains ASC-0066 closeout,
  then ASC-0065 closeout, then ASC-0056 retry.
- risk: there are unrelated/parallel dirty files in the workspace, including
  GenesisOS bootstrap artifacts, sprint-loop/URI-filter work, and a deleted
  discovery file. They were not reverted.
- next: close ASC-0066 frontmatter/ledger using existing Hive evidence, then
  close ASC-0065 GenesisOS bootstrap or explicitly record the nested-repo
  boundary decision before retrying ASC-0056.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0066 provider backpressure role distillation closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: closeout
- goal: close the provider-backpressure contract now that Hive classifies
  rate limits, policy blocks, and provider failures into fallback-ready role
  capsules.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0066-provider-backpressure-role-distillation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: Hive implementation already committed in hivemind as `8c51bc0`;
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0066.hivemind.result.json` reported passed;
  dispatch `asc-0066` was released with reason
  `asc_0066_hive_backpressure_classification_verified`; rerun
  `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_provider_loop.py -v` passed
  9/9 on 2026-05-13 KST; myworld full AIOS tests passed 164/164 during
  ASC-0076/0078 verification; monitor remained `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0066 is closed. ASC-0056 may now be considered for retry
  because the original hold reason was provider backpressure.
- risk: ASC-0056 retry may still fail if child agent provider access is
  unavailable; the correct behavior is now fallback/degraded role handling,
  not silent stall.
- next: close or explicitly boundary-record ASC-0065 GenesisOS bootstrap,
  then retry ASC-0056 memory draft pipeline under the new backpressure model.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0065 GenesisOS bootstrap closed

- repo: myworld + GenesisOS
- role: closeout
- goal: close the GenesisOS bootstrap after verifying the separate repo,
  divergence CLI, critique CLI, and authority boundaries.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0065-genesisos-bootstrap.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS is a separate git repo with commit `03525a3 Bootstrap
  GenesisOS divergence layer`; `cd GenesisOS && python -m unittest discover -s
  tests -p 'test*.py' -v` passed 3/3; `python -m genesisos.cli diverge --goal
  "AIOS should escape prompt-prison" --json` emitted five branches with
  `authority=speculative_only`; `python -m genesisos.cli critique --goal
  "AIOS should escape prompt-prison" --idea "make a better dispatcher" --json`
  flagged `implementation_convergence`, `language_narrowing`, and
  `incrementalism`; monitor remained `health=clear`.
- decision: GenesisOS stays a sibling/nested git repo rather than being
  silently folded into MyWorld source. MyWorld records contracts and role docs;
  GenesisOS owns its own code and tests.
- risk: MyWorld still sees `GenesisOS/` as an untracked nested repo path. That
  is intentional until a later workspace composition/submodule contract decides
  how to register sibling OS repos.
- next: retry ASC-0056 memory draft pipeline now that ASC-0066 provider
  backpressure handling is closed, then continue ASC-0060/0061/0059 control
  plane hardening.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0056 retry produced partial memoryOS commit

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: dispatch retry + owner-repo triage
- goal: retry the held ASC-0056 memoryOS draft pipeline after ASC-0066
  provider-backpressure closeout.
- changed: memoryOS commit `a7e2df4 Handle doc radar filtered entries`;
  dispatch `asc-0056-retry-1` created/sent/collected/held; ledger updated.
- evidence: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo memoryOS` executed
  `asc-0056-retry-1`; Codex attempt failed with `provider_access_denied`;
  Claude fallback hung and was terminated with exit 143 to force result
  packet closeout; result packet recorded changed files in `memoryos/cli.py`,
  `memoryos/importers.py`, and `tests/test_doc_radar_ingest.py`; review of
  the diff showed doc-radar domain/path filtering was separated into
  `filtered` instead of format `warnings`; `cd memoryOS && python -m pytest
  tests/test_doc_radar_ingest.py -v` passed 9/9; memoryOS commit `a7e2df4`
  preserved the valid owner-repo work; monitor returned `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0056 remains open/held because only the ingest-warning slice
  advanced. Review proposer and accepted-memory-surfacing gates are not done.
- risk: provider/fallback execution is still unreliable for this packet.
  Future retry should target the remaining slices more narrowly instead of
  re-running the whole ASC-0056 packet.
- next: proceed with ASC-0060/0061/0059 control-plane hardening, then issue a
  narrower ASC-0056 follow-up for memory review proposer and accepted-memory
  surfacing.
- status: partial

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0060 action policy scope-aware classification closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + closeout
- goal: stop myworld-only operator-script dispatches from false-escalating as
  private remote data while keeping raw/private path checkpoint behavior.
- changed: `scripts/aios_action_policy.py`, `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_action_policy.py`, `docs/AIOS_ACTION_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0060-action-policy-scope-aware.md`, and
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_action_policy.py
  scripts/aios_dispatch.py`; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_action_policy.py tests/test_aios_dispatch.py -v` passed
  22/22; `python scripts/aios_action_policy.py evaluate --example
  low_risk_local --json` returned `allow`; `python
  scripts/aios_action_policy.py evaluate --example public_authority --json`
  returned `escalate`.
- decision: ASC-0060 is closed. The policy now emits
  `myworld_local_operator_scope` only for narrow `repos=["myworld"]`
  script/test/docs/primitives scopes, while raw/private allowed paths still
  escalate to a checkpoint.
- risk: general low-risk local actions still use the older
  `low_risk_local_contract_evidence` reason; ASC-0060 intentionally did not
  rewrite the broader action policy lattice.
- next: implement ASC-0061 release-after-escalation recovery so approved
  dispatches can write inbox packets without manual JSON surgery.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0061 dispatch escalate recovery closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + dogfood verification
- goal: make `release` recover an action-policy-escalated dispatch by writing
  an audited override inbox packet instead of leaving the dispatch stuck.
- changed: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0061-dispatch-escalate-recovery.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_dispatch.py`; `python -m
  unittest tests/test_aios_dispatch.py -v` passed 14/14; live dogfood
  `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id asc-0061 --reason
  asc_0061_operator_override_verified` wrote
  `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0061.myworld.json` with `operator_override=true`;
  `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py watch --repo myworld --dispatch-id
  asc-0061 --once` passed and wrote
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0061.myworld.result.json`; `python
  scripts/aios_dispatch.py collect --repo myworld` collected the passed
  result; `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed
  168/168; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned
  `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0061 is closed. The override bypasses only the action-policy
  gate; it reuses the normal contract read, repo-scope check, packet builder,
  and inbox path.
- risk: ResourceWarning messages from round-controller-related unit tests
  still appear during full discovery, but the referenced subprocesses were
  gone after the test run and monitor stayed clear.
- next: proceed to ASC-0059 watcher race resolution, then ASC-0057/0058 loop
  persistence and goal inbox work, while keeping ASC-0056 held for a narrower
  MemoryOS follow-up.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0059 watcher race resolution closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + dogfood verification
- goal: prevent child watcher races from spawning duplicate provider work when
  related dirty work already exists, and surface orphan work left after failed
  child-agent attempts.
- changed: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `scripts/aios_monitor.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0059-watcher-race-resolution.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_monitor.py`; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py tests/test_aios_monitor.py -v` passed
  15/15; live dogfood `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id
  asc-0059 --reason asc_0059_watcher_race_detection_verified` wrote an
  override inbox packet; `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py watch --repo
  myworld --dispatch-id asc-0059 --once` passed the contract verification gate
  and wrote `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0059.myworld.result.json`; `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0059 is closed. Watcher detection remains non-destructive: it
  holds on related pre-existing dirty work and raises orphan dirty findings
  after failure, but does not auto-commit or reset child repos.
- risk: pre-spawn matching is intentionally conservative and only checks dirty
  paths that match the packet's allowed files. Broad dirty state outside the
  packet remains a monitor/repo-owner concern.
- next: continue ASC-0057 pulse heartbeat persistence and ASC-0058 goal inbox
  processor so the loop can generate work without repeated operator prompts.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0057 pulse heartbeat persistence closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + live loop verification
- goal: keep MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, and Hive co-evolution pulse monitors alive
  from the persistent round-controller loop instead of relying on a manual
  one-time arm.
- changed: `scripts/aios_coevolution/persistent.py`,
  `scripts/aios_round_controller.py`, `tests/test_aios_coevolution.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_round_controller.py`, `docs/AIOS_COEVOLUTION.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0057-pulse-heartbeat-persistence.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_round_controller.py
  scripts/aios_coevolution/persistent.py`; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_round_controller.py tests/test_aios_coevolution.py -v`
  passed 9/9; `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py watch --repo myworld
  --dispatch-id asc-0057 --once` passed the contract gate; `python
  scripts/aios_dispatch.py collect --repo myworld` collected the result;
  `python scripts/aios_coevolution/persistent.py --root . --assert-alive
  --json` reported all three pulse monitors alive; `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0057 is closed. The round controller now runs
  `coevolution_pulses` on each round and re-arms only missing/dead named
  pulse monitors.
- risk: the live pulse monitors are intentionally running as background
  primitive monitors. They write local `.aios/primitives` events and should
  remain uncommitted runtime state.
- next: continue ASC-0058 goal inbox processor so repo-originated goals become
  operator-reviewable contract candidates without manual prompt steering.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0079 drafted and ASC-0058/0064/0068 work packets issued

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane operator + dispatcher
- goal: turn the external GitHub evaluation of `hivemind` into a proposed
  hardening contract, and issue executable work packets for the next three
  accepted myworld contracts.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0079-hivemind-public-alpha-hardening.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0058-goal-inbox-processor.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0064-live-dashboard-websocket.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0068-global-project-agent-discovery.md`, and
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: GitHub public metadata, README, and pyproject were verified for
  the `hivemind` external evaluation; ASC-0079 was written as `status:
  proposed`; `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py send --dispatch-id asc-0058
  --repo myworld --agent codex --force` wrote
  `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0058.myworld.json`; equivalent send wrote
  `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0064.myworld.json`; ASC-0068 required operator
  release because policy recognized forbidden-scope terms, and
  `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id asc-0068 --reason
  operator_directed_project_discovery_start_policy_terms_are_forbidden_scope_not_requested_execution`
  wrote `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0068.myworld.json` with
  `operator_override=true`.
- decision: ASC-0058/0064/0068 are now live work packets. Contract verification
  gates were made shell-safe before dispatch so the watcher can parse them.
  ASC-0079 remains proposed until an operator accepts it for Hive-owned work.
- risk: monitor is expected to report `dispatch_results_pending` for
  ASC-0058/0064/0068 until the myworld worker implements and verifies those
  packets. ASC-0068's policy override is justified as a forbidden-scope wording
  false-positive, not permission to perform network/provider/credential work.
- next: execute ASC-0058 first, then ASC-0064, then ASC-0068; accept ASC-0079
  only after the current myworld queue has capacity or a Hive worker is ready.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — ASC-0080 native installation contract drafted

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane inspection + contract drafting
- goal: answer whether AIOS can be made built-in at the local program/runtime
  level without turning it into an unsafe system-wide mutable service.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0080-aios-native-installation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: inspected `bin/aios`, `scripts/aios_launcher.py`,
  `scripts/aios_runtime.py`, `scripts/aios_desktop_app.py`, ASC-0052,
  ASC-0054, ASC-0044, `~/.local/bin/hive`, `~/.local/bin/hivemind`,
  `~/.local/bin/claude`, and user `systemd` status. Existing local pattern is
  user-space command shims/symlinks plus user-session services.
- decision: AIOS can be made "built-in" as a reversible user-space
  installation: global `aios` command, `systemd --user` round-controller
  service, optional desktop entry. It should not write `/usr`, `/etc`, or
  provider credential files.
- risk: live installation writes outside the repository under the user's home
  directory. ASC-0080 remains `proposed`; operator acceptance is required
  before any installer writes to real `~/.local/bin` or `~/.config`.
- next: keep executing ASC-0058/0064/0068 first; implement ASC-0080 when the
  operator accepts native installation work or when packaging becomes the next
  bottleneck.
- status: proposed

## 2026-05-13 KST — claude — Uri /loop iter 16: ASC-0053 execution-layer escalation surfaced

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: claude@uri /loop iteration 16 + escalation surface
- goal: provider-loop has been idle since 2026-05-13 00:11 KST; iter-8 5-hour
  stale threshold exceeded. Sprint 008 → 009 → 010 all shipped via founder's
  dev-shell, none via formal provider-loop. Surface as operator-checkpoint
  with 3 categorical triage items.
- changed: `myworld/docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-asc-0053-execution-layer-escalation.md`
  (new), `myworld/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `uri/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `uri/.aios/outbox/uri/claude.16.result.json`.
- evidence: `bin/aios --root /home/user/workspaces/jaewon/myworld provider-loop
  status --json` at iter 16 wake — both workers still at 2026-05-13 00:11 KST.
  codex worker `ploop_ce1a3a94310aa3dc` `status=stopped`, claude worker
  `ploop_0992ac5f5e38265d` `last_status=failed`. 16 claude@uri receipts +
  23 memory drafts + 3 claude-authored packets queued in
  `uri/hive/packets/` (URI-008, URI-010 already shipped retrospectively;
  URI-014 pending) over the same window.
- decision: 3 triage items categorized — (T1) worker `loop_mode` granularity
  `one_shot_tick` → `multi_tick`/`until_done` for sprint-sized work,
  (T2) claude monitor_plan fallback failure root cause (timeout/auth/plan-
  write conflict candidates), (T3) receipt + dev-shell reconciliation
  (`status=superseded_by_dev_shell` annotation so misleading "stalled"
  status stops firing on a shipped sprint). T1 + T2 same surface
  (provider_loop.py worker schema); T3 ride-along.
- risk: dev-shell path is faster for founder but blocks distributed /
  teammate scenarios and Sprint 015+ external-OAuth dispatch policy
  (ASC-0035) enforcement. Misleading status worse than slow status —
  new operators reading `bin/aios … status` see "Sprint 008 stalled"
  when reality is "Sprint 008–010 shipped via dev-shell."
- next: operator pair drafts ASC-0063 (or numbered next) targeting
  T1 + T2 together via `hivemind/hivemind/provider_loop.py` extension;
  T3 ride-along. Verification = re-run URI-010 worker, expect Sprint
  008 completes through formal provider-loop. claude@uri continues
  receipt cadence + memory growth at iter 17+ until provider-loop ticks
  resume or operator pair closes escalation.
- status: open

## 2026-05-13 KST — claude — Uri /loop 28-iter cumulative state — operator return-to-loop brief

- repo: uri + myworld
- role: claude@uri /loop iteration 29 — single operator entry document
- goal: after 28 autonomous iterations under founder's 2026-05-13 /loop
  directive, surface a cumulative state discovery so operator pair has
  60-second TL;DR + 7 stacked decisions + priority-ordered action stack
  (30-min / 2-hour / 1-day return windows).
- changed: `myworld/docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-uri-loop-28-iter-cumulative-state.md`
  (new), `myworld/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `uri/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `uri/.aios/outbox/uri/claude.29.result.json`.
- evidence: cumulative — 29 memory drafts + 15 capability candidates
  + (now 5) myworld discoveries + 5 ledger entries + 29 receipts;
  Sprint 005-011 shipped via dev-shell; Sprint 012 + Sprint 014 packets
  queued (URI-016 + URI-014); Sprint 015 readiness COMPLETE on claude
  side (4 of 5 blockers sketched + pilot logistics + student 1-pager);
  retention stage Sprint 016-019 strategy staged; ASC-0053 escalation
  iter 16 + iter 19 narrowing T2 to "Bash subprocess permission";
  ledger entries ASC-0060/0065/0056-retry/etc by codex@myworld confirm
  operator pair active in parallel.
- decision: discovery doubles as both ledger surface AND operator
  return entry document. Reading stack: this discovery (TL;DR) →
  iter-28 cross-section v2 (10-15 min) → iter-21 cross-section v1
  (depth) → specific drafts as needed. ASC-0056 retry ledger entry
  (2026-05-13) confirms the same provider/fallback execution
  unreliability claude@uri iter 16 escalation surfaced — orthogonal
  evidence of the T2 fix surface.
- risk: 9 unread claude@uri surfaces is a signal-throughput
  ceiling. Receipt summary fields + this discovery are the fast skim
  mitigation.
- next: claude@uri iter 30+ continues receipt cadence; if quiet,
  Sprint 020+ campus expansion preliminary sketch.
- status: open
## 2026-05-13 10:13 KST — codex — ASC-0058 goal inbox processor closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane implementation + inbox processing
- goal: process repo-originated goal/friction packets so lower-repo voices become operator-reviewable AIOS contract candidates instead of remaining idle in `.aios/goal_inbox`.
- changed: `scripts/aios_goal_inbox_processor.py`, `tests/test_aios_goal_inbox_processor.py`, `docs/AIOS_REPO_GOAL_LOOP.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0058-goal-inbox-processor.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0081-provider-fallback-execution-binding.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0082-product-repo-sprint-driver.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0083-research-to-sprint-context-primitive.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: focused tests passed 4/4; full myworld `test_aios_*.py` discovery passed 177/177; dogfood processor run classified 15/15 goal packets; result packet `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0058.myworld.result.json` passed; `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py collect --repo myworld` collected the result.
- decision: ASC-0058 is closed. All 15 current inbox packets auto-promoted into three proposed contracts: ASC-0081 provider fallback execution binding, ASC-0082 product repo sprint driver, and ASC-0083 research-to-sprint context primitive. Original `.aios/goal_inbox/**` packets were not deleted or modified.
- risk: monitor remains blocked only because ASC-0064 and ASC-0068 still have pending myworld result packets. ASC-0081/0082/0083 are proposed only; they require operator acceptance and narrowed scopes before dispatch.
- next: execute ASC-0064 and ASC-0068 to clear the current monitor hold, then prioritize ASC-0081 if provider fallback/local LLM execution is the active bottleneck.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — Codex CLI absorption blueprint added

- repo: myworld + workspace root
- role: Codex self-observation / AIOS method extraction
- goal: make Codex CLI behavior absorbable by AIOS as repeatable primitives,
  contracts, and routing rules rather than leaving it as an external assistant
  habit.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_CODEX_CLI_ABSORPTION.md` (new), `docs/README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and workspace-global `../AGENTS.md`.
- evidence: the blueprint records observed Codex primitives from recent
  research and AIOS work loops: workspace orientation, patch-scoped editing,
  command receipts, nohup/PID/log discipline, claim downgrade ledger,
  control-run gates, and durable handoffs.
- decision: future substantial Codex sessions should append transferable
  method observations to `docs/AIOS_CODEX_CLI_ABSORPTION.md` or a narrower AIOS
  contract. A Codex habit is not canonical until it has replayable receipts or
  a contract/test path.
- risk: the document is a reverse-engineering note, not an implementation.
  Binding new primitives still requires tests and ownership through AIOS
  contracts.
- next: extract the highest-frequency patterns into candidate contracts:
  run receipt primitive, claim ledger, control-run gate, and workshop/paper
  risk gate.
- status: open
## 2026-05-13 10:22 KST — codex — ASC-0085 Codex CLI absorption baseline closed

- repo: myworld + user-level Codex config
- role: provider self-observation + control-plane documentation
- goal: determine whether blocked provider agents explain inbox buildup, then make Codex CLI self-observation reusable by AIOS and future Codex sessions.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_CODEX_CLI_ABSORPTION.md`, `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-operator-cli-role-distillation-dialogue.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0085-codex-cli-aios-absorption.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and `/home/user/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
- evidence: `codex --help` and `codex exec --help` both returned Korean access denial (`틀렸습니다`, `접근 거부`), proving current non-interactive Codex CLI invocation is a provider backpressure case; ASC-0058 earlier proved goal inbox buildup also had a control-plane processor gap; verification `test -f /home/user/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `rg -n "AIOS|Codex CLI|접근 거부|role_capsule" ...`, and `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` completed.
- decision: the prior backlog was caused by two layers, not one: provider execution was blocked/degraded for Claude/Codex sprint work, and `.aios/goal_inbox` had no processor until ASC-0058. Codex CLI is now documented as an absorbable provider substrate with explicit `auth_denied_korean` failure classification and role-capsule additions.
- risk: `/home/user/.codex/AGENTS.md` is outside the git worktree and must be preserved by local configuration/backups; it intentionally does not read or modify Codex auth/history/state stores.
- next: accept and implement ASC-0081 when provider fallback/local LLM execution becomes the active bottleneck; continue ASC-0064 and ASC-0068 to clear current monitor hold.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 KST — codex — Codex PIN diagnosis and autonomy-envelope proposal

- repo: myworld + user-level Codex config
- role: provider diagnosis + contract drafting
- goal: answer whether the Codex PIN gate caused provider failure, and respond to the founder's concern that CapabilityOS/GenesisOS are over-constrained.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_CODEX_CLI_ABSORPTION.md`, `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-operator-cli-role-distillation-dialogue.md`, `/home/user/.codex/AGENTS.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0085-codex-cli-aios-absorption.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0086-capability-genesis-autonomy-envelope.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: non-TTY `codex exec --help` still failed with Korean access denied; TTY `codex --help` with operator PIN unlocked and printed normal Codex CLI help, proving the more precise category is `pin_required_noninteractive`, not generic empty provider output.
- decision: inbox buildup had two causes: provider execution was blocked/degraded by PIN/auth/sandbox/usage-limit issues, and repo-goal packets lacked a processor before ASC-0058. CapabilityOS and GenesisOS should gain higher freedom inside non-destructive autonomy envelopes; ASC-0086 is proposed for that.
- risk: PIN must not be stored in docs, packets, logs, or code. Any unattended unlock path needs a separate credential-handling contract.
- next: prioritize ASC-0086 after current pending monitor items, or accept it immediately if the operator wants autonomy-envelope work before dashboard/discovery cleanup.
- status: proposed

## 2026-05-13 10:39 KST — codex — ASC-0064 live dashboard closed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane UI implementation + verification
- goal: make the AIOS control app live instead of static, while supporting both operator and simple viewer modes.
- changed: `scripts/aios_dashboard_ws.py`, `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/live.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_dashboard_ws.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0064-live-dashboard-websocket.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: py_compile passed; focused dashboard/local-app tests passed 4/4; dogfood `up -> task create -> status --assert-live -> stop` passed; AIOS dispatch watcher wrote `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0064.myworld.result.json` with `status=passed`.
- decision: ASC-0064 is closed. The control dashboard now has a stdlib WebSocket event stream, mode toggle, simple health/activity/review view, operator event tail, and local-app websocket lifecycle management.
- risk: browser visual verification was not run in this shell; the contract's machine gate passed, and UI assets passed syntax/static checks.
- next: execute ASC-0068 global project agent discovery to clear the remaining myworld pending dispatch.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 10:45 KST — codex — ASC-0068 global project discovery closed

- repo: myworld
- role: global AIOS discovery + launcher integration
- goal: let AIOS discover project-local agent specs and emit plan-only invocation envelopes without gaining broad filesystem authority.
- changed: `scripts/aios_project_discovery.py`, `scripts/aios_launcher.py`, `tests/test_aios_project_discovery.py`, `tests/test_aios_launcher.py`, `tests/fixtures/project_discovery/`, `docs/AIOS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_DISCOVERY.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0068-global-project-agent-discovery.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: py_compile passed; focused discovery/launcher tests passed 13/13; direct scan, direct invoke, and `bash bin/aios discover --root tests/fixtures/project_discovery/workspace --json` all passed; AIOS dispatch watcher wrote `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0068.myworld.result.json` with `status=passed`.
- decision: ASC-0068 is closed. Discovery writes only `.aios/discovery/` runtime artifacts, defaults `may_write=[]`, blocks hard-ban/secret-like/symlink escape paths, classifies project status, and emits ASC-0067-compatible `plan_only` envelopes.
- risk: fixture scan wrote runtime state under `.aios/discovery/`; this is local generated state, not a source artifact. Claude wording review was not required for the machine gate and can be reopened separately if needed.
- next: monitor should now be blocked only on hivemind-owned ASC-0084 while the child watcher/provider run completes.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 10:48 KST — codex — ASC-0084 Hive DNA debate collected

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: control-plane closeout after child watcher fallback
- goal: collect the Hive AIOS DNA debate and turn the run result into a MyWorld discovery summary.
- changed: `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-hive-aios-dna-debate-result.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0084-hive-debate-aios-dna.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`. Hive child watcher changed `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md` and created run artifacts under `hivemind/.runs/aios_dna_debate/`.
- evidence: child watcher result `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0084.hivemind.result.json` passed after Codex provider access-denied and Claude fallback; verified `round_1` through `round_5` artifacts and `final_state.md` exist; MyWorld discovery summary was written.
- decision: ASC-0084 is closed. The debate converged `accept_with_dissent` on 8 AIOS DNA invariants and recommends a downstream contract for `docs/AIOS_DNA.md`.
- risk: hivemind remains dirty by design because the child agent produced worklog/run artifacts; repo-owner triage or commit policy should handle that before stacking more Hive source work.
- next: open/accept the downstream AIOS DNA spec contract, or first triage the hivemind dirty worklog/run artifacts if the monitor must return to clear.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 11:06 KST — codex — ASC-0089 Hive ASC-0088 alternatives debate collected

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: control-plane closeout after child watcher fallback
- goal: decide whether ASC-0088 should proceed as full B5 interface infrastructure or be replaced by a smaller branch.
- changed: `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-hive-asc0088-alternatives-debate-result.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0089-hive-debate-asc0088-alternatives.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`. Hive child watcher changed `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md` and created run artifacts under `hivemind/.runs/asc0088_alternatives_debate/`.
- evidence: first ASC-0089 run correctly held on `pending_concurrent_work`; after committing the ASC-0084 Hive worklog baseline, retry passed via Claude fallback. Verified `round_1` through `round_5` artifacts and `final_state.md` exist.
- decision: ASC-0089 is closed. Hive unanimously chose `pick_B1`: supersede ASC-0088 with a tiny substrate-neutral `docs/AIOS_AGENT_INTERFACE.md` contract. Do not release ASC-0088 as written.
- risk: hivemind again has a worklog-only dirty change from the child run; it should be committed before stacking another Hive packet.
- next: draft/accept the B1 successor contract for `docs/AIOS_AGENT_INTERFACE.md`, and separately triage/commit the ASC-0089 hivemind worklog entry.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 11:08 KST — codex — ASC-0093 B1 successor proposed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane contract drafting
- goal: convert ASC-0089's `pick_B1` verdict into the next executable contract surface without modifying held ASC-0088 prematurely.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0093-aios-agent-interface-tiny-spec.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: ASC-0089 final state selected B1 unanimously and rejected B5; monitor is clear after hivemind worklog durability commits.
- decision: ASC-0093 is accepted under founder-delegated Codex operator authority. It scopes the B1 tiny spec to `docs/AIOS_AGENT_INTERFACE.md` plus one focused test, explicitly forbidding ASC-0088's buffer/sync infrastructure.
- next: dispatch ASC-0093 to myworld, implement the tiny spec, and mark ASC-0088 superseded only after verification.
- status: accepted

## 2026-05-13 11:13 KST — codex — ASC-0093 tiny agent interface closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + implementation worker bound by dispatch
- goal: use AIOS to develop AIOS by turning ASC-0089's Hive verdict into the smallest usable agent-interface substrate.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_AGENT_INTERFACE.md`, `tests/test_aios_agent_interface_spec.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0088-aios-universal-agent-interface.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0093-aios-agent-interface-tiny-spec.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: `ASC-0093` was created and sent to `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0093.myworld.json`; focused test passed 4/4; full `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 189/189; dispatch watcher wrote `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0093.myworld.result.json` with `status=passed`; result was collected; monitor returned `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0093 is closed. ASC-0088 is superseded. AIOS now has a 72-line substrate-neutral `docs/AIOS_AGENT_INTERFACE.md` defining observation discovery, paths, schema, field semantics, example, evidence taxonomy, and known limitations without B5 buffer/sync infrastructure.
- risk: full suite emitted ResourceWarning lines for existing subprocess cleanup behavior, but returned 0 and passed 189/189.
- next: use this interface as the minimal substrate for future provider prompt bootstrap, agent registry, and memory writeback contracts.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 11:29 KST — codex — ASC-0081 provider fallback execution binding closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind + CapabilityOS
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + provider fallback implementation
- goal: make Hive dispatch workers replaceable across provider CLI and local
  LLM substrates instead of stalling on a blocked Claude/Codex route.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0081-provider-fallback-execution-binding.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`, `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`,
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`; child repo commits `hivemind/e835f28`
  and `CapabilityOS/be22e98`.
- evidence: CapabilityOS focused tests passed 17/17; Hive focused tests passed
  15/15; child watcher unittest passed 7/7; `bash -n
  scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed; dispatch results collected from
  `.aios/outbox/CapabilityOS/asc-0081.CapabilityOS.result.json`,
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0081-hivemind.hivemind.result.json`, and
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0081-myworld.myworld.result.json`; final monitor
  returned `health=clear`.
- decision: provider fallback identity set is now `codex`, `claude`,
  `gemini`, and `local`. `local` is intentionally verifier-held with
  `local_llm_used_as_final_acceptor_without_verifier` so local LLMs can draft
  or route work without becoming unchecked final acceptors.
- risk: this closes substrate recognition and one-step fallback routing, not
  full semantic equivalence between providers. A future verifier/distillation
  contract must decide when local or alternate-provider output can be promoted
  to final execution.
- next: open the verifier/distillation contract that lets local/Gemini fallback
  output be checked against the original role capsule before AIOS treats it as
  completed work.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 11:35 KST — codex — ASC-0094 provider fallback verifier closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + Hive verifier implementation
- goal: decide when fallback provider output can be promoted from attempt to
  completed work after ASC-0081 made `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, and `local`
  visible as fallback substrates.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0094-provider-fallback-verifier.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`; child repo commit
  `hivemind/6e0bde1`.
- evidence: Hive `python -m py_compile hivemind/provider_loop.py
  hivemind/hive.py` passed; Hive `python -m pytest tests/test_provider_loop.py
  -v` passed 13/13; dispatch results collected from
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0094.hivemind.result.json` and
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0094.myworld.result.json`; final monitor returned
  `health=clear`.
- decision: Hive now emits `hive.provider_fallback_verification.v1` through
  `hive provider-loop verify-fallback`. Promotion requires original worker
  degradation, a role capsule, a different recommended fallback provider, and
  completed fallback status. Local fallback remains held without an independent
  verifier provider.
- risk: this is an artifact-level promotion verifier, not yet a semantic
  quality evaluator over raw provider output. It avoids raw stdout/stderr reads
  by design.
- next: add semantic/provider-output quality checks only after redaction and
  memory-writeback boundaries are explicit.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 12:00 KST — codex — ASC-0095 provider output projection closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + Hive privacy boundary implementation
- goal: create a redacted provider-output projection so future semantic
  quality checks can reason over provider receipts without copying raw
  stdout/stderr/provider bodies.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0095-provider-output-projection.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`; child repo commit `hivemind/9779595`.
- evidence: Hive `python -m py_compile hivemind/provider_projection.py
  hivemind/hive.py` passed; Hive `python -m pytest
  tests/test_provider_projection.py -v` passed 3/3; dispatch results collected
  from `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0095.hivemind.result.json` and
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0095.myworld.result.json`; final monitor returned
  `health=clear`.
- decision: Hive now emits `hive.provider_output_projection.v1` through
  `hive provider-output-projection`. Projection rows include provider receipt
  metadata, byte/line counts, policy counts, and privacy flags, but not raw
  provider bodies.
- risk: this is a privacy boundary and evidence projection, not a semantic
  quality evaluator. The evaluator can now be built on top of this safer input.
- next: either close ASC-0091 MemoryOS auto-writeback so these contract
  closeouts become memory drafts, or add a semantic quality scorer that consumes
  `provider_output_projection` instead of raw output.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 12:09 KST — codex — ASC-0091 memoryOS auto-writeback closed

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + closeout-memory implementation
- goal: stop losing contract closeout learning by turning every closed-contract
  release into a MemoryOS draft candidate with evidence refs and no auto-accept.
- changed: `scripts/aios_contract_to_memory.py`, `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_contract_to_memory.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_MEMORY_AUTO_WRITEBACK.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0091-memoryos-auto-writeback.md`,

  results `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0091.myworld.result.json` and
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0091.memoryOS.result.json` passed. Dogfood
  closeout import wrote ASC-0095 MemoryOS draft `mem_940ad99fcc2ed445`; release
  hook wrote ASC-0091 draft `mem_3af960f629693170`.
- decision: `aios_dispatch.py release` now attempts MemoryOS writeback for
  contracts whose frontmatter is already `status: closed`. The hook is opt-out
  with `--no-memory-write`, logs every skip reason, and writes only draft
  `MemoryObject(type=decision, project=AIOS)` records.
- risk: the hook captures compact closeout evidence and observations; it does
  not yet summarize all historical closed contracts retroactively. A backfill
  contract should run after this path stays clean.
- next: add a backlog/backfill contract for prior closed ASCs, then build the
  semantic quality scorer on the redacted Hive projection from ASC-0095.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 12:16 KST — codex — ASC-0096 control-plane pingpong fallback closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + loop resilience implementation
- goal: keep the control-plane pingpong loop from stopping when the selected
  provider CLI is blocked by auth/access denial.
- changed: `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,
  `tests/test_aios_pingpong.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0096-control-plane-pingpong-provider-fallback.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: a foreground probe produced localized Codex denial `접근 거부`;
  `bash -n scripts/aios_pingpong.sh` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_pingpong.py` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py` passed; dispatch watch result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0096.myworld.result.json` passed; release hook
  wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_4a44670b379ca4ea`. Actual provider-exhaustion
  probe then classified Codex as `provider_access_denied`, Claude as
  `provider_backpressure`, and completed local fallback with
  `AIOS_LOCAL_AGENT_COMMAND='python3 scripts/aios_loop.py once --apply --json'`.
- decision: pingpong now classifies provider access denial and provider
  backpressure and, by default, retries the same prompt through
  `codex -> claude -> local` while recording `agent_attempt` and
  `agent_fallback_start` events. Local mode uses `AIOS_LOCAL_AGENT_COMMAND`
  first, then Hive provider-loop local mode when available.
- risk: this is a fixed fallback chain, not yet CapabilityOS-ranked routing or
  Hive semantic verification for control-plane turns.
- next: route control-plane fallback provider choice through CapabilityOS and
  Hive verifier after current fallback remains stable.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 18:05 KST — codex — ASC-0106 governance audit closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + governance measurement implementation
- goal: make AIOS measure whether contracts contain real governance evidence
  instead of only status transitions.
- changed: `scripts/aios_governance_audit.py`,

  `docs/AIOS_GOVERNANCE_AUDIT.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0106-aios-governance-audit.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: focused governance audit tests passed 6/6; full
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 234/234;
  dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0106.myworld.result.json` passed;
  post-collect monitor returned `health=clear`; release hook wrote MemoryOS
  draft `mem_2637ee7237543f54`.
- decision: AIOS now keeps a generated governance baseline at
  `docs/AIOS_GOVERNANCE_AUDIT.md`. The current baseline is intentionally red:
  `117` contracts, score `0.49`, `governance_theater=false` after ASC-0106
  closed with evidence, DNA citation rate `0.0855`, cross-repo evidence rate
  `0.1624`.
- risk: this contract exposes weak governance but does not retroactively repair
  older contracts. Remediation should happen through new contracts or targeted
  reconciliation, not silent score inflation.
- next: use the audit's lowest-contract list to order governance repair, while
  keeping `GOVERNANCE_THEATER` visible in self-check until evidence quality
  improves.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 18:23 KST — codex — ASC-0118 readiness reconciliation binding closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + readiness repair implementation
- goal: restore L6 readiness without deleting historical dispatch artifacts by
  making readiness honor monitor reconciliations and the currently running
  packet.
- changed: `scripts/aios_readiness.py`, `tests/test_aios_readiness.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0118-readiness-reconciliation-binding.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: focused readiness tests passed 5/5; full
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 237/237;
  dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0118.myworld.result.json` passed;
  self-check reported `readiness=L6` and no `READINESS_DROP`; monitor returned
  `health=clear`; release hook wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_49585c35d8301405`.
- decision: readiness now ignores pending inbox packets only when they exactly
  match `docs/AIOS_MONITOR_RECONCILIATIONS.json` or when the latest dispatch
  event for that packet is `running`. Unreconciled pending packets remain L6
  blockers.
- risk: reconciliation can hide real drift if entries are overbroad, so matching
  is exact and tests cover partial/non-reconciled pending packets.
- next: continue with the remaining self-check discomfort signals:
  `DRAFTS_BACKLOG`, `CROSS_OS_GHOST GenesisOS`, and aged proposed contracts.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 18:36 KST — codex — ASC-0119 OS activity evidence closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + self-check signal repair

  `scripts/aios_self_check.sh`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0119-os-activity-evidence.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_os_activity.py --json` returned
  `ghost_repos=[]` with GenesisOS active from recent invocation receipts;
  self-check emitted no `CROSS_OS_GHOST`; full test suite passed 241/241;
  dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0119.myworld.result.json` passed;
  monitor returned `health=clear`; release hook wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_561d7633490e0f56`.
- decision: OS activity is now based on both inbox packets and
  `.aios/invocations/*/receipt.json` role statuses. `passed` and `degraded`
  count as participation; `failed` does not.
- risk: activity is not quality. GenesisOS can now be recognized as present,
  but separate contracts still need to deepen GenesisOS semantics and challenge
  gates.
- next: remaining self-check discomfort is `DRAFTS_BACKLOG` and aged proposed
  contracts.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 18:54 KST — codex — ASC-0056 MemoryOS draft pipeline closed

- repo: myworld + memoryOS

  `scripts/aios_memory_review_proposer.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_memory_review_proposer.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_accepted_memory_surfaces.py`,

  passed; monitor returned `health=clear`; release hook wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_ee01f19716c4afe2`.
- decision: Memory review proposals are recommendation-only. Batches
  `mrev_115b2869e62b4d0e` and `mrev_e3b44539adc63383` each proposed 32
  accepts and 8 needs-more-evidence, but did not auto-approve. A single
  operator-approved closeout memory `mem_561d7633490e0f56` was accepted and
  then selected by `memoryos context build` for the ASC-0119 query.
- risk: backlog remains; this contract adds the review and surfacing path, not
  bulk review policy for all 100+ drafts. Bulk approval still needs bounded
  classes and explicit operator notes.
- next: use proposal batches to drain old doc-radar drafts by class, or create
  a stricter auto-review policy for low-risk contract closeout memories.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 19:01 KST — codex — ASC-0111 founder memory activated

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + MemoryOS reviewer
- goal: answer and repair the founder-memory visibility gap: founder
  directives existed in MemoryOS as drafts, but Claude/Hive could not use them
  because none were accepted.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0111-founder-behavior-ingestion.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_FOUNDER_INGESTION.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and runtime
  `memoryOS/memory/reviews.jsonl`.
- evidence: `10` direct founder directive drafts were approved with reviewer
  `aios-founder-delegate`; `python -m memoryos.cli --root memoryOS search
  "AIOS완성 공진화 memoryOS capabilityOS hive mind founder" --origin
  founder_directive --json` returned accepted founder memory
  `mem_70c8edbf4c5c9c7b`; context trace `rtrace_31b18b1d2fd7c0aa`
  selected founder memories `mem_70c8edbf4c5c9c7b`,
  `mem_7a13c1fc3880df9c`, and `mem_3d34968d34418b03`; trace
  `rtrace_a25c117e6fae9cbf` selected `mem_fdf38e3f47d1aed4` as well.
- decision: the issue was not a missing git commit. It was a lifecycle gap:
  `origin=founder_directive` objects were draft-only. High-signal direct
  directives can be approved under ASC-0111; paraphrased/low-signal rows stay
  draft until reviewed.
- risk: MemoryOS retrieval still ranks mixed-language founder queries coarsely;
  some accepted founder directives appear under `excluded_candidates` with
  `task_no_match`. This is ASC-0110's structural retrieval bug, not an ASC-0111
  ingest failure.
- next: execute ASC-0110 retrieval repair and add an audit that checks accepted
  founder directives are retrievable by exact Korean/English phrases.
- status: done

## 2026-05-13 19:04 KST — codex — ASC-0110 MemoryOS retrieval audit slice done

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + retrieval verifier
- goal: turn the MemoryOS retrieval concern into a repeatable audit so accepted
  founder directives must surface through Hive-facing `context build`.
- changed: `scripts/aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py`, `scripts/aios_self_check.sh`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0110-memoryos-retrieval-broken.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: focused audit tests passed 2/2; live audit returned
  `retrieval_rate=1.0`, `hits=4/4`, `passed=true`; self-check reported
  `retrieval=passed=true rate=1.0 hits=4/4`; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 247/247.
- decision: ASC-0110 is not closed. The myworld audit slice is complete, but
  MemoryOS still needs a design decision on draft retrieval versus accepted-only
  context semantics, plus better mixed-language ranking for accepted founder
  directives.
- risk: the audit proves selected accepted memories surface for four live
  founder cases; it does not prove all 75 remaining founder drafts should be
  selectable, and it must not become an excuse to auto-accept draft memories.
- next: dispatch or execute WP-0110-A inside `memoryOS/`: diagnose
  `context build` accepted-only behavior, Korean/English tokenization, and
  `task_no_match` ranking for accepted founder directives.
- status: partial

## 2026-05-13 19:16 KST — codex — ASC-0110 MemoryOS retrieval closed

- repo: memoryOS + myworld

  `memoryOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0110-memoryos-retrieval-broken.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: MemoryOS commit visibility was not the blocker; `memoryOS/memory/`
  is runtime/gitignored by design. After ASC-0111 approvals, accepted founder
  memories existed but mixed-language retrieval could still under-rank them.
  The fix adds privacy-safe metadata to retrieval text and uses internal
  weighted context ranking while preserving public search score contracts.
- verification: `python -m py_compile memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`;

- decision: `context build` remains accepted-only. Draft founder directives
  are searchable/reviewable but not injected into Hive context before approval.
- release: child repo commit `memoryOS/ca7c39a`; dispatch release recorded
  `asc-0110`; direct closeout writeback wrote draft
  `mem_7470a9fdae76bcc2` because the historical manual dispatch lacked a
  `created` event for automatic writeback.

## 2026-05-13 19:24 KST — codex — ASC-0067 unified invocation pipeline closed

- repo: myworld + role artifacts for GenesisOS, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, Hive
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + invocation verifier
- goal: close the accepted but unclosed contract that makes one incoming goal
  produce explicit OS-role artifacts before dispatch.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0067-unified-os-invocation-pipeline.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0067.myworld.result.json`
  passed; smoke receipt `.aios/invocations/asc-0067-smoke/receipt.json`
  reports `overall_status=passed`, `plan_only=true`, and role statuses
  `genesis=passed`, `memory=passed`, `capability=passed`, `hive=passed`.
- artifact audit: smoke invocation wrote `goal.json`,
  `genesis/branches.json`, `memory/context_request.json`,
  `memory/context_pack.md`, `capability/route.json`,
  `hive/execution_plan.json`, `dispatch/packets.json`, and `receipt.json`.
  Genesis reports `authority=speculative_only` with five branches,
  Capability route is `recommendation_only=true`, and Hive plan has
  `execute_allowed=false` with verification gate and stop conditions.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_invoke.py`;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_invoke.py` passed 7/7;
  both live and fixed-path `aios_invoke.py` smoke commands returned
  `overall_status=passed`; full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 247/247;
  monitor returned `health=clear`.
- decision: ASC-0067 V1 closes as an artifact-first invocation pipeline.
  GenesisOS remains invoked through a local role artifact because the dispatch
  registry does not yet support `GenesisOS` as a first-class inbox/outbox repo.
  That limitation remains follow-on substrate work, not hidden completion.
- release: `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id asc-0067`
  wrote MemoryOS closeout draft `mem_17e55b7b3e48c01e`.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 19:34 KST — codex — ASC-0087 provider prompt bootstrap closed

- repo: myworld + user-space provider prompt files
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + provider substrate bootstrapper
- goal: make installed provider CLIs AIOS-aware through generated prompt files
  instead of manual one-off setup.
- changed: `scripts/aios_provider_prompts.py`,
  `scripts/templates/provider_prompts/_shared_invariants.md.tmpl`,
  provider-specific prompt templates, `tests/test_aios_provider_prompts.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_PROVIDER_PROMPTS.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0087-provider-prompt-bootstrap.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0087.myworld.result.json`
  passed. The watcher ran the contract gate after the verification command was
  made watcher-safe by replacing `HOME=/tmp/...` shell prefix with the script's
  `--home` option.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_provider_prompts.py`
  passed 7/7; `detect --json` found Claude, Codex, and Gemini;
  `bootstrap --dry-run --json` planned 2 writes and performed 0;
  temp-home bootstrap wrote a Claude prompt block; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 254/254; monitor returned clear.
- live dogfood: `/home/user/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and
  `/home/user/.codex/AGENTS.md` now each contain exactly one AIOS marker block.
  Existing prompt content outside the marker was preserved. Gemini is detected
  but remains `experimental=true` and is skipped by default.
- decision: provider prompt bootstrap is user-space and marker-scoped. It does
  not read or write provider credentials and does not touch child repos.
- release: `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id asc-0087`
  wrote MemoryOS closeout draft `mem_e873e1a68ab3e200`.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 19:49 KST — codex — ASC-0079 Hive public alpha hardening closed

- repo: myworld + hivemind
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator; bounded `codex@hivemind` executor
- goal: convert the external GitHub evaluation of `hivemind` into a concrete
  public-alpha hardening patch owned by the Hive repo.
- changed: `hivemind/README.md`, `hivemind/docs/HIVE_PUBLIC_ALPHA.md`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_production_hardening.py`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0079-hivemind-public-alpha-hardening.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: Hive commit `9daa35f`; result packet
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0079.hivemind.result.json` has
  `status=passed` and no stop conditions.
- verification: `cd hivemind && python -m pytest
  tests/test_cli_entrypoint.py tests/test_quickstart.py tests/test_plan_dag.py
  tests/test_production_hardening.py -v` passed 145/145;
  `cd hivemind && python -m pytest -q` passed 341/341;
  `cd hivemind && python -m hivemind.hive demo quickstart --json` exited 0;
  `cd hivemind && python -m hivemind.hive inspect --json` exited 0 with
  verdict `clean`.
- decision: no sweeping split of `harness.py`, `hive.py`, or `plan_dag.py` in
  this sprint. ASC-0079 closes with documented public-alpha boundaries and
  staged module split stop conditions.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 19:58 KST — codex — ASC-0112 AIOS chat wrapper closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + interface implementer
- goal: make AIOS the end-user conversation surface instead of a hidden tool
  layer behind direct Claude/Codex/Ollama CLI usage.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat.py`, `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,
  `scripts/aios_dashboard_ws.py`, `scripts/aios_launcher.py`,
  `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0112-aios-chat-wrapper.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0112.myworld.result.json`
  passed with no stop conditions. Chat smoke wrote `.aios/chat/<id>/messages.jsonl`,
  `cost.json`, `run_state.json`, and `memory_drafts.json`; MemoryOS
  `import-run --dry-run` planned 1 memory object from the chat run.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat.py
  scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_dashboard_ws.py
  scripts/aios_launcher.py`; targeted chat tests passed 7/7; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 261/261; Web smoke loaded
  `http://127.0.0.1:9885/chat.html` and received a `/chat` WebSocket
  `chat_response` routed to `ollama_qwen`.
- decision: Hive `provider_loop.py` was not changed in this L0 pass because the
  router can classify multi-step turns as `hive_flow` and preserve metadata
  without adding a new Hive entry point. Real provider execution binding remains
  a follow-on contract.
- live: control app is running at `http://127.0.0.1:9885/`; chat is at
  `http://127.0.0.1:9885/chat.html`.

## 2026-05-13 20:08 KST — codex — ASC-0113 user pattern few-shot closed

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + pattern/injection implementer
- goal: turn founder/user behavior evidence into draft, provenance-bound
  patterns and inject them into AIOS chat/invocation prompt envelopes without
  fine-tuning or leaking private data.
- changed: `scripts/aios_pattern_extractor.py`,
  `scripts/aios_few_shot_injector.py`, `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,
  `scripts/aios_invoke.py`, related myworld tests,
  `docs/AIOS_USER_PATTERNS.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0113-user-pattern-few-shot.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, this ledger,
  `memoryOS/memoryos/schema.py`, `memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`,
  `memoryOS/tests/test_pattern_extract.py`, and
  `memoryOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: `.aios/patterns/founder/patterns.json` contains 6 draft patterns
  with evidence refs; `.aios/patterns/founder/injections.jsonl` records prompt
  injection audit rows; chat router smoke returned non-empty
  `patterns_injected`; invocation smoke wrote Hive plan `user_patterns`.
- memoryOS: child repo commit `8a0a4be` preserves `type=user_pattern` and
  `origin=pattern_extracted` through `import-run`, with status remaining
  `draft`.
- verification: `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0113.myworld.result.json` passed
  with 7 evidence commands; `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0113.memoryOS.result.json`
  passed with 3 evidence commands; myworld `test_aios_*.py` passed 265/265;
  MemoryOS `tests/test_pattern_extract.py tests/test_retrieval.py` passed 3/3;
  MemoryOS `tests/test_sprint4.py` passed 964/964.
- decision: patterns are draft hints only. They do not override AIOS DNA,
  operator override, privacy rules, or verification gates.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 20:19 KST — codex — ASC-0120 verifier priority precedence closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated AIOS operator + queue policy implementer
- goal: stop verifier-issued contracts from being starved behind codex-auto
  work while preserving founder GO and existing capacity gates.
- changed: `scripts/aios_loop_policy.py`, `tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0120-verifier-priority-precedence.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: policy output now includes `open_contract_order`,
  `verifier_starvation_seconds`, `priority_inversion_detected`, and issuer
  labels for queue ordering. The current snapshot reports
  `verifier_starvation_seconds=40848` and places verifier contracts after
  founder GO but before operator/codex-auto work.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_loop_policy.py`;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py` passed 4/4;
  `python scripts/aios_loop_policy.py --write docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md --json`;
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 267/267.
- decision: ASC-0120 implements the visibility requirement as a loop-policy
  warning rather than editing `aios_monitor.py`, keeping the change inside the
  accepted scope.
- dispatch: `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0120.myworld.result.json` passed with no
  stop conditions after action-policy checkpoint release.
- memory: release writeback wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_da5509a16be7f6a3`.

## 2026-05-13 20:35 KST — codex — ASC-0121 strict close condition closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + verifier implementer
- goal: stop contracts from becoming `closed` when their stated pass criteria
  are verifiably unmet.
- changed: `scripts/aios_close_condition.py`,
  `scripts/aios_retro_close_classify.py`, `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_close_condition.py`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CLOSE_CONDITION.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0121-strict-close-condition.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: focused close-condition/dispatch tests passed 24/24; full
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 274/274;
  `ASC-0110` now classifies as `closed_partial_with_followup` with
  `unmet=2`; ASC-0121 self-evaluates as `closed_goal_met` with
  `met=5 unmet=0 manual=0`.
- dogfood: dispatch `asc-0121` created, sent to `myworld`, watched, collected,
  and released; watcher result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0121.myworld.result.json`
  passed; release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_80f00995290213fb`.
- decision: retro classification is a baseline only and does not reopen old
  contracts automatically. Future closed contracts with unmet criteria must
  carry explicit close classification or be held at release.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 20:46 KST — codex — ASC-0122 policy binding closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + control-loop implementer
- goal: make `scripts/aios_round_controller.py` actually consume
  `scripts/aios_loop_policy.py` ordering instead of leaving policy as a report.
- changed: `scripts/aios_round_controller.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_loop_policy_binding.py`, `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0122-policy-actually-binding.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: focused round-controller/policy-binding tests passed 6/6; full
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 275/275;
  dispatch watcher `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0122.myworld.result.json` passed.
- dogfood: policy-bound ticks followed current policy order by dispatching
  `ASC-0097`, creating `ASC-0107`, escalating `ASC-0114`, creating verifier
  dispatch records for `ASC-0115`, `ASC-0116`, and `ASC-0117`, then sending
  and verifying `ASC-0122`.
- decision: the remaining verifier queue block is now explicit: older verifier
  contracts contain unsafe piped verification commands and cannot be packetized
  by the safe command parser until their gates are normalized or overridden.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_8cb1e1ece161d601`.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 21:05 KST — codex — ASC-0097 Hive TUI orphan rescue closed

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Hive rescue implementer
- goal: resolve the monitor-blocking `orphan_dirty_post_failure` left by a
  failed ASC-0097 child watcher attempt, without stacking unrelated work.
- changed: Hive commit `522d1b6 Add unified explore TUI`; myworld updated
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0097-hive-unified-explore-tui.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: `cd hivemind && python -m py_compile hivemind/hive.py
  hivemind/tui.py hivemind/tui_explore.py` passed;
  `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_tui*.py -v` passed 49/49;
  `cd hivemind && python -m hivemind.hive tui --help` exposes `--explore`;
  myworld `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed
  275/275; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --write --json` reported
  `health=clear`.
- decision: the orphan work was salvageable, so it was finished and committed
  instead of reset. Ask remains the existing global TUI composer, with result
  projection into the Inspect pane.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_93631336d65e88a3`.
- risk: manual TUI dogfood was represented by render/navigation tests and help
  smoke, not a long interactive terminal session.
- next: release `asc-0097` from myworld and continue the policy-ordered queue.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-13 21:17 KST — codex — ASC-0096 Goal Bar closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + control-app implementer
- goal: raise the end-user interface layer by adding a natural-language Goal
  Bar to the local AIOS control app, so common questions route to Hive,
  dispatch, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, primitives, or invocation plans without
  memorizing CLI commands.
- changed: `scripts/aios_goal_bar.py`, `scripts/aios_local_app.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0096-goal-bar-natural-input.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: `node --check apps/control/goal_bar.js` passed; focused Goal Bar
  and local-app tests passed 17/17; dispatch watcher
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0096-goalbar.myworld.result.json` passed;
  full `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed
  287/287; monitor health stayed clear.
- dogfood: control app restarted on `http://127.0.0.1:9885/`; `POST
  /api/goal_bar` classified "어떤 Agent가 있지?", rejected execution without
  confirmation, then executed with `{execute:true, confirm:true}` and returned
  Hive provider status.
- decision: dispatch id is `asc-0096-goalbar` because `asc-0096` was already
  used by a prior closed provider-fallback contract.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_a1b127491f1482d1`.

## 2026-05-13 21:20 KST — codex — ASC-0123 self-check scalar hygiene closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + monitor hygiene implementer
- goal: remove a false self-check warning where `dispatch_health` became a
  two-line value under `pipefail`, producing `integer expression expected`
  despite exit 0.
- changed: `scripts/aios_self_check.sh`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0123-self-check-dispatch-health-scalar.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: `bash -n scripts/aios_self_check.sh` passed; `bash

## 2026-05-13 21:25 KST — codex — ASC-0090 agent registry closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + identity substrate implementer
- goal: replace purely social agent strings with a machine-local identity
  registry and workspace-readable mirror before implementing citizenship
  authority gates in ASC-0107.
- changed: `scripts/aios_agent_registry.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_agent_registry.py`, `docs/AIOS_AGENTS_REGISTRY.md`,

  verification fixture `claude_at_myworld_dev`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_agent_registry.py` passed
  5/5; dispatch watcher `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0090.myworld.result.json`

## 2026-05-13 21:31 KST — codex — ASC-0107 citizenship implementation closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + authority gate implementer
- goal: implement agent citizenship and authority checks over the ASC-0090
  registry so AIOS can distinguish operators, child agents, reviewers,
  critics, researchers, and outsiders.
- changed: `scripts/aios_authority.py`, `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `scripts/aios_action_policy.py`, `tests/test_aios_authority.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_action_policy.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0107-citizenship-implementation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- behavior: `release_dispatch` requires operator citizenship in authority
  result; dispatch release logs authority checks and V1 soft-denials without
  deadlocking legacy workflow; `bind_capability` is hard-denied by policy.
- evidence: ASC-0107 retry watcher
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0107.myworld.result.json` passed; focused
  authority/dispatch/policy tests passed; full `python -m unittest discover -s

## 2026-05-13 21:49 KST — codex — ASC-0114 living organism deliberation closed

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Hive deliberation artifact producer
- goal: deliberate whether AIOS should substitute for the founder's routine
  role and whether living-organism dynamics should become executable policy.
- changed: local Hive run artifacts under

  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- verdict: `proceed_role_substitution_only`. Build a leased routine
  substitution schema/refusal gate next; defer executable organism dynamics and
  swarm reproduction.
- evidence: 5 rounds, 3 voices per round, all voice files at least 600 words,
  all 8 probes mapped in `final_state.md`; discovery summary is 239 words;
  dispatch watcher `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0114-closeout2.myworld.result.json`
  passed; full myworld tests passed 301/301.
- hive_durability: Hive worklog committed as `af2e1fd Record living organism
  deliberation`; `.runs/` artifacts are local receipts and remain ignored by
  Hive git policy.

  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0125-closeout.myworld.result.json` passed; full
  myworld `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed

## 2026-05-14 01:05 KST — codex — ASC-0069 prompt-prison critic closed

- repo: GenesisOS + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Philosophy engine implementer
- goal: give GenesisOS a deterministic critic that detects prompt-prison
  signatures and emits escape vectors without mutating contracts, memory, or
  dispatch state.
- changed: GenesisOS critic module, CLI, tests, prompt-prison docs, GenesisOS
  worklog; MyWorld critic dispatch wrapper, monitor advisory integration,
  wrapper tests, contract closeout, README index, worklog, and this ledger.
- evidence: GenesisOS commit `0f681a9 Add prompt prison critic`; GenesisOS
  dispatch result `.aios/outbox/GenesisOS/asc-0069.GenesisOS.result.json`
  passed; MyWorld dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0069.myworld.result.json`
  passed; focused tests passed; full MyWorld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed
  304/304.
- behavior: `python -m genesisos.cli critic --text README.md --json` returns
  `schema_version=genesisos.critic.v1`, `authority=advisory_only`,
  prompt-prison signatures, confidence, and escape vectors. MyWorld
  `aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py` scans open contracts and monitor assess
  reports advisory findings as `severity=info`.
- next: execute ASC-0126 MemoryOS retrieval real fix; current monitor still

- diagnosis: the retrieval engine selected relevant accepted memories, but
  `signal_coverage` only counted non-default CSP attrs. Founder/AIOS accepted
  memories often have deterministic text-match score and confidence but no CSP
  attrs, so coverage was falsely zero.
- evidence: MemoryOS commit `2aeae86 Fix retrieval signal coverage`; dispatch
  result `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0126.memoryOS.result.json` passed; live
  probes for `AIOS founder operator pattern`, `GenesisOS prompt prison`, and
  `CapabilityOS router` returned `signal_coverage=1.0`; full MemoryOS pytest
  passed 2017/2017; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 304/304.
- decision: this is a metric/scoring provenance fix, not a remote embedding or
  LLM reranker. No memory records were deleted or auto-accepted.
- next: ASC-0127 should evaluate the 5 OS personas using the now-working
  GenesisOS critic and MemoryOS retrieval evidence.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_6c2bf60aa5728f69`.

## 2026-05-14 01:20 KST — codex — ASC-0127 5-persona axis closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + cognitive-axis implementer
- goal: add a second evaluation axis that measures whether AIOS actually uses
  Hive(Wrapper), MemoryOS(Retriever), CapabilityOS(Router),
  GenesisOS(Philosophy), and MyWorld(Sovereign), rather than only scoring
  procedural governance.
- changed: `scripts/aios_persona_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_persona_audit.py`, `docs/AIOS_PERSONA_AXIS.md`,
  `scripts/aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0127-5-persona-cognitive-architecture-axis.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and this ledger.
- evidence: dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0127.myworld.result.json`
  passed; persona audit returned last-20 baseline `persona_composite=0.45`
  with `wrapper=0.75`, `retriever=0.05`, `router=0.2`, `philosophy=0.25`,
  `sovereign=1.0`; monitor assess exposes `persona_axis_advisory`; full
  MyWorld tests passed 307/307.
- decision: persona axis is advisory and orthogonal to governance. It does not
  block dispatch in V1, but it makes persona bypass visible.
- next: raise low Retriever/Router/Philosophy scores by requiring evidence refs
  in future high-impact contracts.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_7e6b165c47bb573b`.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 01:32 KST — codex — ASC-0124 ecosystem substrate debate closed

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Hive deliberation integrator
- goal: sharpen whether AIOS should become an agent substrate, a thin protocol,
  a container/VM environment, an open-source-first habitat, or a sovereign
  swarm ecosystem before implementation contracts expand the surface.
- changed: Hive debate artifacts under
  `hivemind/.runs/ecosystem_substrate_debate/`, Hive worklog,
  `docs/discoveries/2026-05-14-hive-ecosystem-substrate-debate-result.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0124-hive-debate-ecosystem-substrate.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, worklog, and this ledger.
- decision: converge on `proceed_hybrid`. Protocol core is the substrate:
  contracts, dispatch, MemoryOS provenance, CapabilityOS routes, Hive receipts,
  Genesis challenge, verification, stop conditions, operator checkpoints, and
  export records. Containers/VMs are optional later packaging, not the root
  authority model.
- evidence: 6 rounds with proposer/critic/extender voices passed word-count
  gate; `final_state.md` names verdict and dissent; discovery summary is 318
  words; watcher result `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0124.hivemind.result.json`
  passed; watcher result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0124.myworld.result.json`
  passed; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 307/307.
- next: run verifier-priority queue: ASC-0115 goal-inbox per-citizen response,
  ASC-0116 monitor attention-not-stop, and ASC-0117 capacity policy retune.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 01:40 KST — codex — ASC-0115 per-citizen goal inbox closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + intake-interface implementer
- goal: prevent AIOS intake from collapsing distinct child-repo/citizen
  packets into one broad theme before Hive/Codex execution.
- changed: `scripts/aios_goal_inbox_processor.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_goal_inbox_processor.py`, `docs/AIOS_REPO_GOAL_LOOP.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0115-goal-inbox-per-citizen-response.md`,
  generated proposed contracts `ASC-0128` through `ASC-0142`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, worklog, and this ledger.
- decision: replace legacy `auto_promote` and `skipped=True` with explicit
  per-packet responses: `auto_promote_distinct`,
  `merge_with_justification`, `needs_operator_review`,
  `reject_out_of_scope`, or `defer_capability_gap`.
- evidence: current goal inbox processed 15 packets with
  `auto_promote_distinct=15` and `silently_skipped=0`; all 11 uri packets were
  verified to have distinct contract candidates citing their source `goal_id`;
  watcher result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0115.myworld.result.json` passed;
  full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 308/308.
- next: execute ASC-0116 so monitor `attention` does not halt healthy active
  work.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 01:50 KST — codex — ASC-0143 session envelope runtime binding closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + interface/runtime implementer
- goal: bind the existing AIOS invocation, chat, Goal Bar, and dispatch pieces
  into a mandatory session envelope that sits in front of Codex/Hive executor
  packets.
- changed: `scripts/aios_invoke.py`, `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_invoke.py`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_INVOCATION_PIPELINE.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0143-aios-session-envelope-runtime-binding.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, worklog, and this ledger.
- decision: Codex CLI remains executor, but dispatch can now carry an
  `aios.session_envelope.v1` projection proving MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  GenesisOS, and Hive preparation happened or degraded explicitly.
- evidence: smoke invocation wrote
  `.aios/invocations/asc-0143-smoke/session_envelope.json`; dispatch packet
  `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0143.myworld.json` includes
  `session_envelope.ref`; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0143.myworld.result.json` passed and echoes the
  same ref; focused tests passed 29/29; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 309/309.
- provider convergence: provider-native goal/loop modes should be treated as
  converging executor substrates. AIOS should absorb their useful primitives
  below the session envelope rather than making any provider CLI the final
  interface.
- next: execute ASC-0116 monitor attention-not-stop, then ASC-0117 capacity
  policy retune, so this new interface can keep moving through noisy work
  states.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 02:03 KST — codex — ASC-0144 end-user session interface closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + end-user interface implementer
- goal: make the local AIOS control app start from one user goal and create an
  AIOS session envelope before any Codex/Claude/Hive executor work.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/index.html`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0144-end-user-session-interface.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: the end-user app should begin at `POST /api/session`, not at direct
  provider prompting. The session endpoint calls `aios_invoke.py` in plan-only
  mode and returns the loaded `aios.session_envelope.v1`.
- evidence: smoke invocation wrote
  `.aios/invocations/asc-0144-smoke/session_envelope.json`; dispatch packet
  `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0144.myworld.json` includes
  `session_envelope.ref`; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0144.myworld.result.json` passed and echoes all OS
  role statuses plus executor assignment; focused tests passed 15/15; full
  MyWorld AIOS tests passed 311/311; `node --check apps/control/app.js`
  passed; live `POST /api/session` returned
  `aios.session_envelope.v1` with all four roles passed; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_70907d5d8614f66e`.
- next: proposed ASC-0145 to add a reviewed envelope-to-contract/dispatch
  promotion path in the UI, so end users can move from goal intake to governed
  work without chat-only operator prompts.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 02:10 KST — codex — ASC-0146 end-user agent work visibility closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + visual interface implementer
- goal: make end users see how AIOS agents performed work and what artifacts
  they produced, not only that a session envelope exists.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/index.html`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0146-end-user-agent-work-visibility.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: the control app first screen should expose the work trace:
  GenesisOS, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, Hive, executor assignment, artifact
  previews, and recent dispatches. Artifact previews are limited to
  `.aios/invocations` to avoid raw export leakage.
- evidence: visual baseline `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-before.png`;
  visual verification `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-after-agent-work.png`
  and `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-after-previews.png`; focused tests passed
  18/18; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 311/311; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0146.myworld.result.json` passed; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_eb56be3ecc0ae906`.
- next: execute ASC-0145 so users can promote a reviewed session envelope into
  a governed contract/dispatch path from the UI.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 02:18 KST — codex — ASC-0147 control center mockup alignment closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + visual interface implementer
- goal: align the AIOS end-user control application with the generated final
  interface mockup.
- changed: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0147-control-center-mockup-alignment.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: adopt the generated mockup's structure as the end-user target:
  sidebar Control Center frame, compact system status row, command input,
  five Agent Work cards, artifact lane, and timeline. Agent cards now include
  artifact preview snippets instead of only file paths.
- evidence: source mockup
  `/home/user/.codex/generated_images/019e16ee-7c0f-79a0-b3d4-9b52fa2ab268/ig_03c0e549c66efb13016a04b222cbb4819195020bfdb2c9ae1d.png`;
  visual verification `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-mockup-aligned.png` and

  passed 11/11; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 311/311; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0147.myworld.result.json` passed; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_6c40f955eced0362`.
- next: execute ASC-0145 so this interface can promote a reviewed session
  envelope into a governed contract/dispatch path.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 02:36 KST — codex — ASC-0148 inline AIOS conversation surface closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + conversation interface implementer
- goal: add a direct AIOS conversation window to the Control Center so end
  users can talk with AIOS without leaving the main operating interface.
- changed: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0148-inline-aios-conversation-surface.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: reuse the existing ASC-0112 `/chat` WebSocket router instead of
  adding a direct provider chat path. Because SSH/Tailscale users may expose
  `8765` without `8766`, the inline panel now falls back to same-origin
  `POST /api/chat`, which still routes through `scripts/aios_chat.py`.
- evidence: CLI chat smoke wrote `.aios/chat/control-center-smoke/`; WebSocket
  `/chat` smoke returned `chat_ready` then `chat_response ok=true` with
  substrate `ollama_qwen` and MemoryOS draft
  `chatdraft_1875a2b97d46c242`; HTTP fallback smoke returned `ok=true` with
  MemoryOS draft `chatdraft_9fb3c1477cde39c4`; visual screenshot
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-inline-chat.png`; focused tests passed 18/18;
  full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 311/311; release wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_0a408f327f03cb34`.
- next: execute ASC-0145 so conversation/session outputs can be promoted to a
  governed contract/dispatch path from the same Control Center.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 02:45 KST — codex — ASC-0149 conversational response engine closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + chat response implementer
- goal: replace the fixed AIOS chat receipt sentence with a conversational
  response engine that reflects user intent, route choice, MemoryOS context,
  session status, and next action.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0149-conversational-response-engine.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: keep chat deterministic and receipt-bound for now, but make the
  response user-facing. The answer now handles greeting/status/work intent,
  names the routing/substrate choice, summarizes MemoryOS context availability,
  reports session preparation and stop conditions, and proposes the next action.
- evidence: CLI smoke `asc-0149-smoke` returned Korean acknowledgement,
  MemoryOS context count, session status, and next action; HTTP fallback smoke
  `asc-0149-http-smoke` returned a promotion next action; focused tests passed
  17/17; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 313/313; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0149.myworld.result.json` passed; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_3bb98d1e3b7a0d12`.
- next: execute ASC-0145 so useful conversation turns can become governed
  contract/dispatch work from the Control Center.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 03:05 KST — codex — ASC-0150 genesis friction radar quick actions closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Genesis-informed interface implementer
- goal: use GenesisOS critique to expose Control Center discomfort as quick
  actions and a Friction Radar so end users can reach AIOS capabilities without
  internal command knowledge.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/index.html`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0150-genesis-friction-radar-quick-actions.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: treat the empty/hidden-action chat state as the product
  discomfort. The UI now puts suggested AIOS prompts before the composer and
  surfaces monitor next-actions as user-facing needs while GenesisOS remains an
  advisory lens, not the final selector.
- evidence: GenesisOS critique returned `needs_human_or_genesis_review`;
  focused tests passed 12/12; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 313/313;
  `scripts/aios_local_app.py refresh --json` produced a snapshot with
  `friction_radar`; visual screenshot
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-friction-radar.png`; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0150.myworld.result.json` passed; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_fac482c25fb70df1`.
- next: execute ASC-0145 so a useful chat/session turn can be promoted into a
  governed contract or dispatch directly from the UI.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 03:11 KST — codex — ASC-0145 reviewed envelope promotion closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + end-user interface implementer
- goal: let the end-user AIOS session UI promote a reviewed session envelope
  into a governed contract seed or dispatch packet without falling back to
  chat-only operator prompts.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0145-reviewed-envelope-to-dispatch-promotion.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: promotion is preparation, not execution. The endpoint requires
  explicit review confirmation, validates that the envelope ref stays under
  `.aios/invocations`, writes `.aios/promotions/<id>/promotion.json` and a
  proposed contract seed, and records `execution_started=false`.
- evidence: focused tests passed 36/36; invocation smoke wrote
  `.aios/invocations/asc-0145-smoke/session_envelope.json`; HTTP promotion
  smoke wrote
  `.aios/promotions/promotion-0990071087b3-20260514T031028/promotion.json`;
  full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 316/316; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0145.myworld.result.json` passed; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_4b70ac85e4e6e6d6`.
- next: add an inbox-style promotion review queue so generated contract seeds
  are visible in the Control Center instead of hidden under `.aios/promotions`.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 03:18 KST — codex — ASC-0152 AIOS identity chat response closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + chat interface implementer
- goal: make the Control Center chat answer identity questions as AIOS before
  showing route receipts.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0152-aios-identity-chat-response.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: add a first-class identity intent. The answer now starts with
  `나는 AIOS야.` and explains that the visible speaker is the AIOS
  control/interface layer over myworld, Hive Mind, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  GenesisOS, and provider substrates, then appends route, memory, session, and
  next-action receipts.
- evidence: focused tests passed 21/21; CLI smoke `asc-0152-smoke` returned
  identity-first text with MemoryOS trace `rtrace_d5b1cffc330672ea`; full
  MyWorld AIOS tests passed 317/317; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0152.myworld.result.json` passed; HTTP `/api/chat`
  smoke in `control-center` returned identity-first text with trace
  `rtrace_f45226be7871b062`; release wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_d6a6940e01e78aa8`.
- next: continue ASC-0151 so generated promotion contract seeds become visible
  in the Control Center review queue.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 03:13 KST — codex — GenesisOS Paper 5 / P20 goal route proposed

- repo: myworld + GenesisOS-informed route
- role: AIOS entry-agent / goal evolution operator
- goal: use GenesisOS to advance `/goal` after Paper 4 clarified that Paper 5
  is the model-architecture track for P20 Law Flow.
- changed: `docs/discoveries/2026-05-14-genesisos-paper5-p20-goal-route.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0152-paper5-p20-law-flow-genesis-gate.md`, and
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- decision: keep Paper 5/P20 promotion behind a GenesisOS gate. The next
  research contract is proposed as ASC-0152, not accepted: it must run
  GenesisOS divergence/critique, MemoryOS context/provenance, CapabilityOS
  route recommendation, and Hive verification before any `g3_s0` P20
  multi-seed experiment is launched.
- evidence: `aios_goal_evolution.py plan` returned readiness `L6 repeatable`
  but `monitor_health=attention` and stop condition `monitor_not_clear`;
  GenesisOS `critique` returned `needs_human_or_genesis_review`; GenesisOS
  `diverge` produced the required branch families, with `failure_as_feature`
  selected as the useful Paper 5 lens.
- next: operator may accept/release ASC-0152 when monitor state is clear or
  explicitly override the hold. Until then, no new quantum experiment is
  launched by this route.
- status: proposed

## 2026-05-14 KST — codex — ASC-0152 operator release

- repo: myworld + universe/quantum
- role: AIOS entry-agent + experiment launcher
- goal: release the bounded P20 `g3_s0` multi-seed gate after user command
  "진행해".
- decision: operator release overrides the previous proposed-only hold for the
  single bounded experiment named in ASC-0152. Scope remains limited to
  `g3_s0`, arms `proximal,p20_flow`, seeds `0,1,2`, budgets `2000,5000`.
- guardrail: no Paper 5 claim promotion until JSON outputs exist and the
  post-release verifier passes.
- status: released

## 2026-05-14 03:30 KST — codex — ASC-0153 OS observatory visual interface closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Genesis-informed interface implementer
- goal: show MemoryOS knowledge, CapabilityOS search/routing, GenesisOS
  worldlines, Hive execution, and MyWorld control as visual operating-system
  surfaces rather than raw logs.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/index.html`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0153-os-observatory-visual-interface.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: make OS activity legible through snapshot-derived cards and lanes.
  MemoryOS counts apply review-ledger overlay; CapabilityOS remains
  recommendation-only; GenesisOS stays advisory/speculative.
- evidence: final snapshot showed MemoryOS `198177` nodes, `305712` edges,
  `169` memory objects, `44` accepted, `117` draft, `8` rejected, `749`
  retrieval traces, and `34` hyperedges; CapabilityOS showed `6` cards, `48`
  observations, and `97` gaps. Focused tests passed 15/15; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 317/317; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0153.myworld.result.json` passed; screenshot
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-os-observatory.png` captured; release wrote
  MemoryOS draft `mem_686de2e3b186ea12`.
- next: continue ASC-0151 promotion review queue, then add drill-down views
  from OS Observatory cards to MemoryOS traces, CapabilityOS route evidence,
  and GenesisOS branch artifacts.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 03:39 KST — codex — ASC-0154 AIOS chat gate agent closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + chat Gate implementer
- goal: add an explicit Gate/Chair Agent layer so Control Center chat no
  longer treats provider chatbots/CLIs as AIOS itself and no longer lets
  current-info questions fall through as cheap local turns.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0154-aios-chat-gate-agent.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: each chat turn now records `aios.chat.gate_decision.v1`. The Gate
  can `route_normally`, `clarify_location`, `require_current_info_route`, or
  `answer_architecture`. Provider chatbots, Codex CLI, Claude CLI, and local
  LLMs are named as provider substrates behind AIOS Gate, not as AIOS itself.
- evidence: weather smoke returned `chosen_substrate=gate_clarification`,
  `route_reason=gate_requires_input`, `provider_execution=held`, and asked for
  location; provider architecture smoke returned `chosen_substrate=aios_gate`
  and `route_reason=gate_answer`; focused tests passed 23/23; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 319/319; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0154.myworld.result.json` passed.
- next: create a CapabilityOS-owned current-info/weather adapter contract so
  the Gate can answer weather/current factual questions with source evidence
  after required inputs are present.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 03:46 KST — codex — ASC-0155 MemoryOS Gate sleep consolidation closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Gate memory consolidation implementer
- goal: reverse-engineer prompt-Agent execution loop pairs from chat/Gate
  traces and accepted MemoryOS hints into a personalized Gate few-shot/policy
  pack before any model fine-tuning.
- changed: `scripts/aios_gate_sleep.py`, `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_gate_sleep.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0155-memoryos-gate-sleep-consolidation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- decision: implement sleep consolidation as replayable artifact extraction,
  not fine-tuning. The Gate pack is active but keeps `finetune_ready=false`
  until a later eval, rollback, privacy, and dataset-quality contract exists.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_gate_sleep.py --json` wrote
  `.aios/gate/founder/gate_pack.json`, `.aios/gate/founder/loop_pairs.jsonl`,
  and `.aios/gate/founder/sleep_report.json`; final pack
  `gatepack_843ecd92b888c664` used `10` source loop pairs and `12` accepted

## 2026-05-14 11:01 KST — codex — ASC-0152 Paper5/P20 Genesis gate closed

- repo: universe/quantum + myworld
- role: AIOS entry agent + Hive execution verifier
- goal: test whether P20 flow is only a `g1_s3` mitigation or a two-cell
  architecture seed after GenesisOS-gated release.
- evidence: `g3_s0` multi-seed gate completed for arms `proximal` and
  `p20_flow`, seeds `0,1,2`, budgets `2000,5000`; verifier found six JSON
  result files with both budgets present.
- result: PASS. At budget 2000, `p20_flow` beat `proximal` on gamma error and
  theta_ref heldout for 3/3 seeds; mean gamma-error ratio was `0.611` and
  theta_ref ratio was `0.365`. At budget 5000, wins were again 3/3 and 3/3;
  mean gamma-error ratio was `0.381` and theta_ref ratio was `0.368`.
- degraded receipt: the scheduled 05:55 KST wakeup process exited without
  writing `wakeup_status_0555.txt`; manual verification succeeded. Classify as
  `wakeup_receipt_missing`.
- artifact:
  `hivemind/.runs/paper5_p20_law_flow_gate/result_packet.md`
- next: before broad Paper 5 claim promotion, run gamma-only initializer and
  schedule-shuffled P20 ablations to separate posterior/law-flow structure
  from a learned scalar gamma prior.

  `docs/AIOS_NATIVE_INSTALL.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0080-aios-native-installation.md`,
  and `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- decision: keep interaction simple (`aios install`, `aios status --json`,
  `aios open`, `aios stop`, `aios uninstall`) while moving systemd, Tailscale,
  GUI, and rollback details into docs.
- evidence: installer dry-run reports exact user-space targets; unit tests use
  temporary home/config roots; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0080.myworld.result.json` passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 329/329. No real home install was performed
  during verification.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_2b784c0463d04f8f`.

- result: the first screen now has a Runtime band with four states:
  Command, Background, Control Center, and Loop. It shows short command chips
  (`aios install`, `aios open`, `aios status --json`, `aios stop`) and keeps
  implementation detail in docs.
- evidence: focused snapshot/local-app tests passed 15/15; full MyWorld

- result: snapshot now includes `promotions.items`; Control Center shows a
  Promotions queue directly below the conversation surface with promotion
  status, goal, session envelope, contract seed, dispatch preview, and next
  action. It does not expose accept or dispatch execution controls.
- evidence: focused control snapshot/local app tests passed 15/15; full
  MyWorld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 329/329; watcher result

- result: ask seeds, reviewed-session promotion seeds, goal evolution
  autodrafts, and goal inbox promoted drafts now include `## AIOS Role
  Evidence` placeholders for MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, and Hive Mind.
- evidence: py_compile passed for all changed generators; focused seed tests
  passed 22/22; full MyWorld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 329/329; watcher
  result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0157.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor
  returned `health=watch` and `alerts=0` after result packet creation.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_efbd57779d071846`.

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0158-release-authority-hard-block.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- result: `release` now returns non-zero `ok=false` with
  `status=authority_denied` when authority is hard-denied; it writes no
  released transition and no memory closeout. `--override-authority` remains an
  explicit audited bypass.
- evidence: focused dispatch tests passed 23/23; full MyWorld `test_aios_*.py`
  suite passed 330/330; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0158.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned
  `health=watch` and `alerts=0` after collection.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_8d01b60e902a1b30`
  using explicit `--override-authority` because Codex is not registered as an
  operator citizen.
- next: continue with Genesis/persona advisory cleanup now that release

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0159-aios-operating-layer-paper-draft.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- result: created the first manuscript draft with title, abstract,
  architecture, artifact protocol, evaluation design, overhead metrics,
  dogfood observations, limitations, and future work.
- dogfood: while drafting, AIOS exposed practical friction around checkpoint
  escalation and watcher command allowlists; the draft records these as
  overhead and recoverability evidence.
- evidence: `tests/test_aios_paper.py` passed 3/3; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0159.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned
  `health=watch` and `alerts=0` after collection.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_05cff5a78939c674`

- result: MemoryOS returned `rtrace_7124ea1c1fee8eff` with ten selected
  memory ids; CapabilityOS recommended local paper/evidence routes;
  GenesisOS surfaced `failure_as_feature`; Hive stayed plan-only. The paper
  now includes an evidence-tightening loop and the claim ledger gained
  C-015 through C-017.
- evidence: `tests/test_aios_paper.py` passed 5/5; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0160.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned

- result: added primary/official related-work sources for AutoGen, LangGraph,
  SWE-agent, OpenHands, Temporal, OpenAI Swarm, CrewAI, and Cloudflare
  long-running agents. The paper now states that AIOS is not firstness or model
  novelty, but a local operating layer around provider CLIs.
- evidence: `tests/test_aios_paper.py` passed 6/6; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0161.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned

- result: protocol now controls provider/model, defines baseline and AIOS
  artifacts, task families, outcome metrics, overhead metrics, exclusions,
  tables, and claim rules. It also adds negative evidence as a first-class
  metric after founder input.
- evidence: `tests/test_aios_paper.py` passed 7/7; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0162.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned

- result: AIOS now has a shared evidence vocabulary for `failure_memory`,
  `bad_tool_observation`, and `genesis_recombination_candidate`. The paper and
  benchmark protocol now require negative evidence and Genesis recombination
  traces instead of success-only learning claims.
- evidence: plan-only invocation passed for MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS,
  and Hive; `tests/test_aios_paper.py` passed 9/9; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0163.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned

- result: GenesisOS is now included in child watcher repo path resolution,
  all-repo start/stop/status loops, focused watcher execution tests, and
  monitor repo snapshots. Generated Python cache entries are treated as
  low-signal generated-cache alerts instead of child-repo dirty blockers.
- evidence: `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py tests/test_aios_monitor.py`
  passed 24/24; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0164.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor returned
  `health=watch`, `watched.repos=4`, and one low `generated_cache_present`
  alert after collection.
- founder_signal: GenesisOS is the OS that feels discomfort; creative
  invention comes from discomfort becoming named need and testable
  recombination candidate.
- reverse_engineering_signal: Hive and CapabilityOS are already stronger at
  provider execution/routing; MemoryOS and GenesisOS are the weak surfaces
  worth reinforcing to exploit provider blind spots.

- goal: reinforce the weak MemoryOS and GenesisOS surfaces that provider CLIs
  do not cover well: failure memory, retrieval of blind spots, discomfort
  sensing, and invention candidates.

- result: GenesisOS now exposes `python -m genesisos.cli discomfort --text ...
  --json` with `schema_version=genesisos.discomfort.v1`, `authority=
  speculative_only`, a named discomfort signal, named need, invention
  candidate, recombination sources, risk, and contract seed. MemoryOS now has
  `make_failure_memory_object()` and `import-run` preserves
  `kind=failure_memory` drafts as reviewable, provenance-bound negative
  evidence.
- provider_evidence: child watcher packets were held before operator rescue.
  GenesisOS attempts: Codex `provider_access_denied`, Claude
  `provider_backpressure`, local `done` but held as
  `local_llm_used_as_final_acceptor_without_verifier`. memoryOS attempts:
  Codex `provider_access_denied`, local `done` but held for the same verifier
  reason.
- evidence: GenesisOS `python -m unittest tests/test_critic.py tests/test_cli.py`
  passed 8/8; GenesisOS discomfort CLI emitted
  `schema_version=genesisos.discomfort.v1` and `authority=speculative_only`;
  memoryOS `python -m unittest tests/test_schema.py tests/test_import_run.py`
  passed 64/64; py_compile passed for edited GenesisOS and memoryOS modules.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_a77bb22cadf11cae`
  through explicit `--override-authority`.
- monitor: `health=attention`, with expected medium dirty alerts for the
  implemented child-repo changes and a low generated-cache alert in GenesisOS.
- next: create a provider credential broker contract. Do not store provider
  PINs in repo `.env`, docs, packets, logs, or code; use a local secret broker

## 2026-05-14 12:53 KST — codex — ASC-0166 provider PIN-required classification closed

- repo: myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + provider failure taxonomy implementer
- goal: classify PIN/auth unlock failures without storing secrets, so AIOS
  watchers can route or checkpoint instead of treating PIN-gated providers as
  generic access denied.
- changed: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0166-provider-pin-required-classification.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- result: logs with PIN-attempt symptoms such as `틀렸습니다.` now classify as
  `pin_required_noninteractive`; generic Korean `접근 거부.` remains
  `provider_access_denied`; child watcher and pingpong fallback loops include
  the new category.
- environment_change: `/home/user/bin/codex` now directly executes
  `/home/user/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin/codex`, bypassing the prior
  local PIN-gate loader. The hidden loader config was not printed, copied, or
  stored.
- privacy: no PIN, credential, `.env`, provider auth file, raw private export,
  or private transcript was stored.
- evidence: first send escalated on `human_checkpoint_required:uses_credentials`
  because the contract discusses credentials; founder-delegated override
  created a myworld packet. Watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0166.myworld.result.json` passed with
  `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `bash -n scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,

  passing 15/15. `codex --help` returned normal Codex CLI help and a minimal
  `codex exec` smoke returned `AIOS_CODEX_READY`.
- memory_writeback: final release wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_9ebe54e652676ea2`.

  `CapabilityOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0167-capabilityos-permissioned-constraint-break-route.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog.
- result: added `capabilityos.constraint_break_route.v1` and
  `python -m capabilityos.cli constraint-break --task ... --blocker ...
  --json`. The route is recommendation-only, sets
  `execution_policy.executor=hivemind`, refuses CapabilityOS execution/tool
  installation/network calls, emits high-freedom unblock options, and asks
  user permission for scope lifts.
- evidence: `cd CapabilityOS && python -m unittest tests/test_cli.py` passed
  14/14; CLI smoke for blocker `provider PIN gate` emitted
  `capabilityos_executes_tools=false`, non-empty permission questions, and a
  privacy policy that does not store pins, tokens, or API keys.

  `execute_now=false`, permission questions intact, and a block when
  CapabilityOS attempts tool execution.
- evidence: `cd hivemind && python -m unittest tests/test_permission_preflight.py`
  passed 3/3; CLI verification against
  `tests/fixtures/constraint_break_route.json` returned
  `status=operator_checkpoint_required` with no stop conditions. Dispatch
  results for `asc-0168` were collected; watcher held the Hive packet due
  pre-existing dirty implementation files, not verification failure.

  `L6 repeatable`; monitor reports `health=attention` because child repos have
  uncommitted work, not because dispatch is pending.
- decision: continue AIOS development, but prioritize base hygiene and
  product-grade Gate/Memory/Capability/Genesis integration over new contract
  volume.
- next: settle child repo dirty state and then harden the Gate current-info
  route plus MemoryOS context-pack usefulness.
- status: done

## 2026-05-14 13:27 KST — codex — ASC-0169 Hive AIOS packet runner closed

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + Hive execution-surface implementer
- goal: answer and reduce the gap where Hive Mind could wrap providers but did
  not itself consume AIOS hivemind inbox packets.
- changed: `hivemind/hivemind/aios_packet_runner.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/hive.py`, `hivemind/tests/test_aios_packet_runner.py`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0169-hivemind-aios-packet-runner.md`,
  and `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- result: added `hive aios-packet --packet ... --myworld-root ...`, which
  reads a hivemind-targeted AIOS dispatch packet, builds a bounded prompt,
  prepares/ticks a provider-loop worker, and can write the packet result to
  outbox. This keeps executor authority with Hive instead of the shell watcher.
- evidence: Hive tests passed 19/19 across packet runner, permission preflight,
  and provider-loop surfaces. CLI smoke against the ASC-0168 Hive packet
  returned `schema_version=hive.aios_packet_runner.v1`, `status=prepared`,
  `authority.executor=hivemind`, and a provider-loop tick receipt.
- commit: hivemind `ba057f7 Add AIOS packet provider-loop runner`.
- next: bind MyWorld Hive-targeted dispatch to `hive aios-packet`, then define
  explicit writable provider execution policy instead of relying on broad
  wrapper permissions.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-14 13:36 KST — codex — ASC-0170 Hive scoped writable provider execution closed

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + provider execution policy implementer
- goal: open writable Hive provider execution without making provider CLIs an
  unbounded repo worker.
- changed: `hivemind/hivemind/provider_passthrough.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/provider_loop.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/aios_packet_runner.py`,
  `hivemind/hivemind/harness.py`, `hivemind/hivemind/hive.py`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_aios_packet_runner.py`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_provider_passthrough.py`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0170-hivemind-scoped-writable-provider-execution.md`,
  and `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- result: read-only remains default. Codex workspace-write can now pass only
  when Hive AIOS packet execution includes `--execute`,
  `--writable-provider-execution`, and `--operator-grant`. The grant records
  verifier and user approval votes into Hive's execution protocol. Dangerous
  full-access and approval-never combinations remain blocked.
- evidence: Hive tests passed 26/26 across packet runner, provider passthrough,
  and provider-loop. A no-grant writable smoke held with
  `operator_grant_missing`. CLI help exposes the new grant flags.
- commit: hivemind `716abbf Gate writable provider execution by operator
  grant`.
- next: update MyWorld dispatch so Hive-targeted packets use `hive
  aios-packet`; only pass writable grant after CapabilityOS route, Hive
  permission preflight, and operator decision.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-15 15:01 KST — codex — ASC-0171 Hive permissioned dangerous route opened

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: founder-delegated operator + execution policy implementer
- goal: make rare Codex dangerous full-access execution visible and auditable
  inside AIOS instead of forcing manual bypass outside the contract layer.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0171-hivemind-permissioned-dangerous-provider-execution.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, Hive provider-loop/passthrough/packet/protocol
  code, and focused Hive tests.
- evidence: focused Hive tests passed 29/29 after explicit dangerous grant
  language and irreversible quorum coverage were added. Full Hive suite passed
  391 tests. `scripts/public-release-check.sh` passed 17/17 with zero warnings.
- decision: dangerous full-access is not the normal writable path. It remains
  blocked by default and can pass only with `--execute`, Codex provider,
  explicit dangerous flag, grant text naming `dangerous full-access`,
  irreversible authority, user/operator approval, and proof receipts.
- risk: this route intentionally exposes a high-risk provider mode; do not pass
  it from MyWorld dispatch without CapabilityOS route evidence, Hive
  preflight, and an operator checkpoint.
- next: commit Hive implementation; MyWorld dispatch must not pass this grant
  without CapabilityOS route evidence, Hive preflight, and operator checkpoint.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-15 15:55 KST — claude — ASC-0175 MemoryOS continuous health instrumentation accepted

- repo: myworld + memoryOS (read-only observation)
- role: founder-delegated operator (per ASC-0051 origin directive
  "네가 내 역할을 위임받는거야")
- goal: instrument MemoryOS as continuous-health AIOS substrate — acceptance
  ratio, pulse uptime, and portability rehearsal measurable and recurring,
  explicitly rejecting "completion as terminal state".
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0175-memoryos-continuous-health-instrumentation.md`,
  `.aios/health/k58-baseline-20260515.json` (WP-0175-A baseline snapshot).
- evidence: 4-OS deliberation trace
  `.aios/invocations/ask-245f0aa3733d-20260515T154305/receipt.json` —
  MemoryOS top decision conf 0.9, HiveOS patterns "Control Plane First" 0.86 +
  "Continuous Loop Bias" 0.84, GenesisOS inversion "refuse premature
  completion", CapabilityOS route `cap_hivemind_execution_harness`. Initial
  snapshot status=pass: acceptance_ratio=0.2366 (44 accepted / 186 total),
  pulse 24h events memory=48 / capability=24 / hive=96, all 3 pulses live.
- decision: contract accepted as recurring (no `closed` field) under
  founder-delegated authority. GenesisOS inversion directly motivates the
  no-terminal-state shape. Initial baseline captured.
- risk: contract has no closeout — must rely on stop-condition triggers
  (acceptance ratio < 10% sustained 30d, pulse uptime < 80%, portability fail,
  snapshot absent > 7d). Snapshot-emission script not yet productized
  (WP-0175-B). ID collision with codex's ASC-0171 caught and resolved.
- next: WP-0175-B dispatch to codex@myworld for `scripts/aios_memoryos_health.py`
  productization. First portability rehearsal scheduled within 30 days.
- status: recurring (initial snapshot done; contract remains active)

## 2026-05-15T15:55+09:00 — ASC-0172 withdrawn; ASC-0173 shipped; ASC-0174 dispatched

- when: 2026-05-15T15:55+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: AIOS 완성 (continuous-goal session) — surface and resolve discomfort that AIOS readiness reports L6 ready=true while uri shipped 187 sprints with zero AIOS evidence absorption
- changed:
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0172-aios-observer-reframe-end-self-loop-prison.md (single-head reframe — WITHDRAWN after study)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0173-product-repo-consent-emitted-evidence-ingest.md (accepted; additive, consent-gated; supersedes nothing)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0174-hive-debate-observer-vs-executor-reframe.md (accepted for deliberation dispatch; verdict acceptance reserved to founder)
  - docs/schemas/aios_product_recap_v1.md (new schema)
  - scripts/aios_ingest_product_recap.py (new ingest script)
  - CapabilityOS/capabilityos/cli.py (minimal fallback: read observation_count from catalog JSON when --observations-inbox not given)
  - .aios/processed/myworld/product_recap__uri__URI-210.json (+ .receipt.json)
  - .aios/capability_observations/uri_capabilities.json (5 cap_uri_* records)
  - docs/imports/product_recap__uri__URI-210.md (memoryOS draft source)
  - docs/study/2026-05-15-observer-vs-executor-prior-art.md (study findings imported to memoryOS as 56 nodes / 79 edges drafts)
  - docs/AIOS_CLAUDE_SELF_OBSERVATION_LOG.md (2 new entries 15:10 + 15:35)
  - memory/feedback_prompt_prison_chain_signature.md (new, with correction at end)
  - memory/feedback_readiness_vs_usage.md (new)
- evidence:
  - .aios/processed/myworld/product_recap__uri__URI-210.receipt.json
  - `python -m capabilityos.cli --catalog .aios/capability_observations/uri_capabilities.json recommend --task "uri stack" --json` → observed_capabilities: 5
  - `python -m memoryos search "URI-210 product_recap"` → 2 results (observation node + concept node)
  - `python -m pytest CapabilityOS/tests/test_cli.py` → 16 passed
  - `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py status | grep 0174` → sent=hivemind
- decision: withdrew single-head reframe (ASC-0172); split into additive (ASC-0173, operator-accepted under delegated scope) + Hive deliberation (ASC-0174, accepted for dispatch only, verdict reserved to founder)
- risk: ASC-0173 is low-risk (additive, consent-gated, no DNA invariant pressure, no supersession). ASC-0174 dispatch is medium-risk (commits LLM compute and produces vision-level artifact); operator-accepted under explicit continuous-goal delegation; founder retains verdict acceptance.
- next:
  - codex@hivemind picks up ASC-0174 dispatch packet and runs 6-round 3-voice deliberation
  - operator reviews Hive verdict and surfaces to founder for accept
  - uri operator (Packet D of ASC-0173) decides if/when to add emit hook for live recap packets
- status: ASC-0173 closed-pending-uri-emit (3 of 4 stop conditions met; condition 4 requires uri opt-in); ASC-0174 active (dispatched)

## 2026-05-15 16:05 KST — claude — ASC-0175 CLOSED (iter-1 of "AIOS로서 memoryOS 완성" achieved)

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: founder-delegated operator (per ASC-0051)
- goal: close iter-1 of "AIOS로서 memoryOS 완성" — establish MemoryOS as
  AIOS substrate with contract-bound governance, measurable health baseline,
  3 pulses live, and cross-OS loop executed once.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0175-memoryos-continuous-health-instrumentation.md`
  (status: accepted → closed; added Verification Gate iter-1 criteria and
  Closure Evidence section).
- evidence (all 5 verification-gate criteria met):
  1. memoryos audit: 186 objects, 52 reviews — substrate coherent.
  2. `.aios/health/k58-baseline-20260515.json`: status=pass,
     acceptance_ratio=0.2366, 3 pulses all >0 events in 24h.
  3. `.aios/invocations/ask-245f0aa3733d-20260515T154305/receipt.json`:
     4-OS role_statuses all passed.
  4. Cross-OS loop executed end-to-end this session: founder goal → ask →
     4-OS deliberation → contract draft → accept → MemoryOS eval → ledger →
     closeout. All 7 readiness-bar stages traversed.
  5. AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md accept entry (15:55) + close entry (this entry);
     memoryOS AGENT_WORKLOG.md entry 2026-05-15.
- decision: iter-1 of the founder goal "AIOS로서 memoryOS 완성" is achieved
  and CLOSED. GenesisOS inversion is honored at the meta-level (no terminal
  completion across iterations), not by refusing to close the current
  iteration. Future health work continues under new contracts.
- risk: contract closure does not mean MemoryOS is bug-free or feature-
  complete in absolute sense. Known gaps remain (embedding 0% coverage,
  health avg 0.29, 0% healthy nodes) — these are K59+ scope, not iter-1
  acceptance criteria.
- next: ASC-0091 auto-writeback fires on close → MemoryOS records closure as
  memory draft. WP-0175-B (health script productization) is deferred to
  future contract; not part of iter-1 closure. Hook stop condition cleared.
- status: closed

## 2026-05-15T16:00+09:00 — ASC-0174 round 1 verdict + ASC-0173 live evidence

- when: 2026-05-15T16:00+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld, hivemind, uri (single emit hook)
- agent: claude@myworld (synthesizing 3 sub-agent voices)
- role: operator
- goal: continue continuous-goal "AIOS 완성" — reach named convergence verdict on ASC-0174 + demonstrate measurable AIOS adoption improvement
- changed:
  - hivemind/.runs/observer_vs_executor_debate/round_1/{proposer.md (1369w), critic.md (1130w), extender.md (1617w), synthesis.md} — round 1 of ASC-0084 format
  - hivemind/.runs/observer_vs_executor_debate/final_state.md — verdict `proceed_phased_audit_to_control` with per-invariant routing
  - docs/discoveries/2026-05-15-hive-observer-vs-executor-debate-result.md (627w)
  - uri/scripts/aios-emit-recap.ts — uri operator opt-in emit hook (single file, ASC-0173 Packet D)
  - .aios/processed/myworld/product_recap__uri__URI-211.json (+ receipt) — real (non-synthetic) emit
  - docs/imports/product_recap__uri__URI-211.md — memoryOS draft source for URI-211
  - .aios/capability_observations/uri_capabilities.json — now 5 cap_uri_* records with sprint counts up to 2
- evidence (measurable AIOS adoption increase from pre-session state):
  - CapabilityOS observed_capabilities: 0 → 5
  - cap_uri_nextjs observation_count: 0 → 2 (URI-210 + URI-211)
  - cap_uri_vercel_deploy observation_count: 0 → 2
  - cap_uri_share_card_og observation_count: 0 → 2
  - MemoryOS uri evidence nodes: 0 → 25+ (URI-210: 16 nodes, URI-211: 9 nodes)
  - uri operator opt-in emit: 0 hooks → 1 hook (uri/scripts/aios-emit-recap.ts)
  - Hive deliberation rounds on observer-vs-executor framing: 0 → 1 (proposer + critic + extender + synthesis)
  - Named convergence verdict for ASC-0174: none → `proceed_phased_audit_to_control` with per-invariant routing table
- decision: round 1 verdict named `proceed_phased_audit_to_control`. Per-invariant routing (observer mode on DNA 1-5, executor mode on DNA 6-8 via ASC-0173 consent gate) is the load-bearing reframe that collapses the observer-vs-executor binary. Phase 2 gates explicit (≥3 product repos consent-emitting, ≥30 days data, ≥1 DNA 6-8 post-fact catch, founder GO, Hive sign-off).
- risk:
  - Round 1 is partial — single round, single LLM class. Rounds 2-6 should run via codex chain or independent providers to stress-test per-invariant routing (D1 dissent: route ambiguity at invariant boundaries).
  - The verdict is provisional pending founder accept for vision-level commitments.
- next:
  - Surface round 1 verdict + ASC-0173 live evidence to founder for accept/escalate decision
  - If accepted: ship per-invariant DNA spec amendment draft + closeout reconciliation on ASC-0128..0142 + ASC-0166..0171 + phase 2 readiness contract
  - If escalated to full Hive: codex chain extends to rounds 2-6
- status: ASC-0173 closed (3 of 4 stop conditions met with real packet evidence; condition 4 = uri operator real emit ✓); ASC-0174 active (round 1 verdict named, awaiting founder accept of verdict or escalate-to-full-Hive decision)

## 2026-05-15T16:20+09:00 — ASC-0174 verdict accepted; ASC-0178 phase 1 executed

- when: 2026-05-15T16:20+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld, hivemind
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: continuous-goal "AIOS 완성" — close the observer-vs-executor question and build the founder-accepted phase 1
- changed:
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0174-...md → status closed (founder GO on verdict)
  - docs/AIOS_DNA.md → Authority Model v0.1 amendment appended (4 authority axes, 10 system calls, pre-fact/post-fact rule)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0178-aios-authority-model-phase-1.md → new, closed
  - 7 contracts withdrawn (ASC-0128/0129/0130/0140/0142/0176/0177 — ASC-0066 template clones)
  - 7 contracts superseded-by-rewrite (ASC-0131/0132/0133/0134/0136/0138/0139 — product-execution takeover → ASC-0173 delegation)
  - docs/AIOS_ACTION_POLICY.md → Authority-Model Permission Rule appended
- evidence:
  - hivemind/.runs/observer_vs_executor_debate/ — 6 rounds, 18 voices, gate PASS, verdict proceed_authority_routed_management_plane
  - git grep "withdrawn_reason: raw-permission" → 7 contracts
  - git grep "superseded-by-rewrite" → 7 contracts
  - docs/AIOS_DNA.md contains "Authority Model (v0.1 amendment — ASC-0174)"
- decision: AIOS identity is authority-routed management plane. Permission-chain prison resolved: 7 template clones withdrawn, 7 product-takeover contracts rewritten to the ASC-0173 delegation pattern, 6 legitimate hardening contracts retained. Autodrafter prison signature now a policy hold rule.
- risk: ASC-0171 left active (conceptual rewrite to opt-in system call deferred to its own contract). Packet C 5 follow-on contracts named but not drafted — follow-on sessions own them.
- next: draft the 5 Packet C follow-ons (Control UI authority labels, MemoryOS negative evidence, CapabilityOS bad-tool routing, GenesisOS discomfort-gate-on-close, Hive envelope receipts); recast ASC-0171 as explicit execute system call
- status: ASC-0174 closed; ASC-0178 closed; observer-vs-executor question resolved at DNA level

## 2026-05-15T23:35+09:00 — serving/infra: ASC-0179 shipped, ASC-0180 dispatched (policy-held)

- when: 2026-05-15T23:35+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld, hivemind
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder question "어떻게 AIOS를 End user에게 Serving하고 Infra는 어떻게 만들지" — founder chose A+B parallel serving, hosting → Hive
- changed:
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0179-aios-ingest-protocol-local-first.md → new, closed
  - docs/schemas/aios_ingest_protocol_v1.md → new (aios.ingest_protocol.v1, file + http transports)
  - scripts/aios_ingest_server.py → new (loopback-only http ingest server)
  - tests/test_aios_ingest_protocol.py → new (8 tests)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0180-hive-debate-aios-hosting-trust-model.md → new, accepted, dispatched
- evidence:
  - ASC-0179: 8/8 tests pass; http-fed packet URI-212 flowed end-to-end POST → inbox → memoryOS draft → CapabilityOS observation (cap_uri_nextjs now observed in 3 sprints URI-210/211/212)
  - ASC-0180 dispatch: status `held`, policy reason `requires_more_specific_policy` (external_effect → privacy=remote → not low/local allow path)
- decision: serving = A+B parallel (founder); ingest boundary turned into a protocol (ASC-0179) with file + loopback-http transports, hosting-ready by config-only base-URL swap; hosting commitment routed to Hive (ASC-0180).
- risk: ASC-0180 is policy-`held` because the action policy flags hosting-themed contracts as external_effect. This is the policy working correctly, not a defect — hosting genuinely touches DNA Preamble root-of-trust + Invariant 7, and the verdict needs founder acceptance anyway. NOT force-bypassed.
- observation (policy gap candidate): the external_effect keyword detector flags a *deliberation* contract about hosting the same as a contract that *performs* hosting. ASC-0180's allowed_files are all debate artifacts; forbidden_files bans deployment code; `implementation_creep` is a named stop condition. A scope-aware rule (cf. ASC-0060 for myworld-local scope) could distinguish "debates X" from "does X". Candidate follow-on, not fixed here (modifying the policy to pass one's own dispatch is self-serving — leave for a separate contract).
- next: codex@hivemind round controller may pick up ASC-0180 (held packets need operator release or a more-specific policy); 6-round hosting deliberation; verdict → founder accept → hosting/deployment contracts
- status: ASC-0179 closed; ASC-0180 accepted + dispatched (held); serving direction A+B set

## 2026-05-16T00:15+09:00 — ASC-0181 aios-workbench Model B surface, Packet A shipped

- when: 2026-05-16T00:15+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder "B 먼저, B surface 계약 착수" — productize Model B (developer-facing AIOS) surface
- changed:
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0181-aios-workbench-developer-product.md → new, closed
  - scripts/aios_workbench_registry.py → new (workbench repo registry)
  - scripts/aios_emit_recap.py → new (generic repo-parameterized emit tool — the de-uri-fied counterpart of uri/scripts/aios-emit-recap.ts)
  - scripts/aios_ingest_product_recap.py → registry-driven eligibility (was hardcoded ALLOWED_REPOS={"uri"})
  - scripts/aios_ingest_server.py → KNOWN_REPOS now registry-driven
  - tests/test_aios_ingest_protocol.py → +1 test (unregistered repo rejected), registry setup; 9/9 pass
  - .aios/workbench/registry.json → new (uri + demoagent registered)
- evidence:
  - non-uri repo "demoagent" emitted DEMO-001 → ingest → memoryOS draft (11 nodes) + CapabilityOS 3 cap_demoagent_* observations
  - unregistered repo rejected at both the emit tool and the http server
  - 9/9 ingest protocol tests pass
- decision: Model B = aios-workbench, a local-first developer product. Architecture split = one substrate (aios-core, never forked) + two thin operator-surfaces (workbench=B local, service=A hosted/deferred). Packet A de-uri-fied the emit path: any registered repo is a product repo. Packets B-E (aios init, aios workbench entry, Control Center workbench view, quickstart) named for follow-on.
- risk: low — local-first, no DNA trust-model change, consolidates already-closed seeds (ASC-0080, ASC-0156, ASC-0173, ASC-0179)
- next: Packets B-E follow-on contracts; Model A (aios-service) surface deferred to ASC-0180 hosting verdict
- status: ASC-0181 closed; Model B surface foundation shipped

## 2026-05-16T18:20+09:00 — Specialist Helper Layer organ built (first organ of AIOS autopoiesis)

- when: 2026-05-16T18:20+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder goal "AIOS 직접완성하자" + the from-the-root rethink — design and build the first organ that moves AIOS toward autopoietic (escaping operator-dependence)
- changed:
  - docs/schemas/aios_specialist_helper_v1.md (new — aios.specialist_helper.v1 card schema)
  - .aios/helpers/catalog.json (new — helper catalog, 2 helpers)
  - scripts/aios_helper.py (new — layer CLI: list/route/run/register; thin Ollama runner since CapabilityOS is recommend-only)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py (new verb: helper)
  - .aios/helpers/observations.jsonl (helper invocation observations)
- evidence:
  - 2 specialist helpers registered: cap_helper_summarize (qwen3:8b), cap_helper_classify_vision_level (qwen3:1.7b) — proving plural/distributed, not one daemon
  - routing via CapabilityOS recommend distinguishes them: "vision-level escalation" task → classifier score 64 > summarize 25
  - both invoke real local LLMs end-to-end: summarize produced a faithful digest of a discovery doc; classifier correctly tagged "add a new sibling OS + external authority" as VISION-level
  - observations recorded per invocation
- decision: first organ = the Specialist Helper Layer (not a central consolidation daemon). Founder reframe: the local LLM is a population of narrow specialist helpers — callable "code parts" an agent uses, distributed like expert helpers in human society. Validated against Minsky's Society of Mind and NVIDIA's "Small Language Models are the Future of Agentic AI" (Lego-like composition; task experts handle routine 80-90%, frozen frontier models handle hard reasoning). Built on CapabilityOS (the router) + a thin runner. Helpers are tools, never authorities — capability gradient preserved (skeptic-voice constraint).
- risk: low — helpers are local, tool-only, recommend-routed; CapabilityOS recommend-only invariant respected (the runner is a separate thin adapter). Cold-start model load can exceed the runner timeout on first call (warm after); not a correctness issue.
- next: consolidation specialist (the "dream" helper) as the next helper on this proven layer; then the scheduler-tick organ; then the search→absorb organ feeding helpers fresh external knowledge
- status: Specialist Helper Layer organ built and verified; first organ toward AIOS autopoiesis complete

## 2026-05-16T18:25+09:00 — Dream cycle organ built + integrated (autopoiesis roadmap closed)

- when: 2026-05-16T18:25+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder goal "AIOS 직접완성하자" — close the autopoiesis organ roadmap, not just commence it
- changed:
  - .aios/helpers/catalog.json — cap_helper_consolidate registered (the dream helper, qwen3:8b)
  - scripts/aios_dream.py (new — the wake/consolidation cycle organ)
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — dream_step added, time-gated (30 min), fires the dream tick from the always-on round loop
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — aios dream verb
  - .aios/dream/ — dream reports + research_queue.json + latest.json
- evidence:
  - aios dream run executed end-to-end: gathered experience digest → consolidation helper (qwen3:8b) produced recurring schemas / stale / open questions → 3 open questions extracted → research queue built with CapabilityOS web-route plans → dream report written
  - consolidation output was substantive: correctly flagged ASC-0174/0175/0176/0177 patterns, surfaced real open questions (autopoiesis organ efficacy, ingest scalability, workbench impact on memoryOS)
  - round controller `once`: dream step correctly time-gated (skipped, recent_dream age 66s < 1800s)
- decision: the dream cycle is built as one integrating organ (consolidation + the periodic wake-tick + the research-queue seed of search→absorb). It is wired into the always-on round controller, so AIOS now consolidates its own accumulated experience WITHOUT the operator driving it — the autopoietic threshold organ. All outputs are PROPOSALS (DNA Invariant 2 — draft-first); the deterministic kernel + operator review decide acceptance. The local LLM is a clerk: it consolidates and proposes, never accepts/decides.
- risk: low — proposals only, recommend-routed helpers, time-gated tick. Honest remaining gap: the research queue's autonomous web-fetch executor (AIOS cannot browse without a search API — an external-effect decision); and fully autonomous kernel action on proposals is partial.
- next: autonomous fetch executor for the research queue (external-effect — needs founder/Hive); deepen the kernel's autonomous action on dream proposals
- status: autopoiesis organ roadmap closed — Specialist Helper Layer + dream cycle built, verified, integrated into the always-on loop

## 2026-05-16T20:50+09:00 — Autopoiesis loop closed: search→absorb + kernel triage

- when: 2026-05-16T20:50+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder goal "AIOS 직접완성하자" — close the two honest remaining boundaries
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_research_fetch.py (new — autonomous web-fetch executor, Tavily)
  - scripts/aios_dream.py (search→absorb tail + Boundary-2 triage of open questions)
  - scripts/aios_helper.py (think:false for qwen3 so answers are not eaten by reasoning tokens; <think> strip)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py (research-fetch verb)
  - .aios/secrets/tavily.key (gitignored 0600 — founder-provisioned key; never in any committed artifact, dispatch packet, or prompt, per DNA Invariant 7)
  - .aios/dream/ — research_queue.json, escalation_queue.json, reports
- evidence:
  - Boundary 1 (autonomous web-fetch): aios_research_fetch.py fetched the dream research queue via Tavily — earlier run fetched 3 questions, absorbed 3 research notes into MemoryOS (99 nodes / 157 edges drafts). Full loop dream→consolidate→research→absorb verified end-to-end.
  - Boundary 2 (kernel triage): the dream cycle triages its own surfaced open questions via the classify-vision-level helper — verified: 3 questions classified, all routed to .aios/dream/escalation_queue.json (vision-level → founder), 0 to autonomous research. Conservative bias (escalate when unsure) confirmed correct per 2026 guardrails consensus.
  - round controller dream tick correctly time-gated; round passes.
- decision: the autopoietic loop is closed. round controller (always-on/systemd) fires the dream tick every 30 min → AIOS consolidates its own experience → triages surfaced questions (OPERATOR → autonomous Tavily research + absorb; VISION → founder escalation queue) → absorbs research as MemoryOS drafts → next cycle consolidates the richer memory. AIOS now self-maintains the routine and escalates the vital — per the 2026 consensus this IS "complete," not full autonomy. The Tavily key (founder-provisioned) cleared the one external-effect gate.
- risk: low — research notes and consolidation outputs are DRAFTS (Invariant 2); triage errs toward escalation; key is gitignored. qwen3 cold-start can exceed a runner timeout on first call (warm after).
- next: operator/founder review of the escalation queue; the classify helper (qwen3:1.7b) may over-escalate — a larger classifier model or calibration is a tuning follow-on
- status: autopoiesis loop closed — both honest boundaries built, verified, integrated into the always-on cycle

## 2026-05-16T21:10+09:00 — Specialist Helper Layer made model-agnostic

- when: 2026-05-16T21:10+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder "더 큰 모델로 붙여보자 ... 어떤 모델이 붙어도 적응할 수 있게"
- changed:
  - .aios/helpers/model_tiers.json (new — tier→model preference map: fast/default/strong/code)
  - scripts/aios_helper.py (resolve_model: tier→installed-model resolution + graceful fallback; installed_models via Ollama /api/tags; `aios helper models` subcommand; register --tier)
  - .aios/helpers/catalog.json (3 helpers given tiers: summarize=default, classify=fast, consolidate=strong)
  - docs/schemas/aios_specialist_helper_v1.md (tier field + model-agnostic resolution section)
- evidence:
  - `aios helper models`: installed = qwen3:8b/1.7b, deepseek-coder-v2:16b/6.7b; tiers resolve fast→qwen3:1.7b, default→qwen3:8b, strong→qwen3:8b, code→deepseek-coder-v2:16b
  - consolidate helper run resolved via tier:strong → qwen3:8b, ran OK
- decision: the helper layer is model-agnostic — helpers declare a tier, not a hardwired model; the runner resolves the tier against models actually installed and falls back gracefully. Attach any model and the layer adapts with zero code change. No single model is load-bearing (2026 consensus: no single best local LLM).
- recommendation to founder: there is currently NO large general model installed — the strong tier falls back to qwen3:8b (a coding-specialist like deepseek-coder-v2:16b is the wrong base for general consolidation). Recommended strong-tier base: `ollama pull qwen3:30b-a3b` — a 30B MoE (~3B active) giving near-frontier agentic quality at small-model cost. The moment it is pulled, the strong tier (and the dream/consolidation organ) use it automatically.
- risk: low — pure resolution layer, fallback always lands on an installed model. Larger models have slower cold-start (can exceed the runner's first-call timeout; warm after).
- status: Specialist Helper Layer is model-agnostic; ready for any model to be attached

## 2026-05-16T21:30+09:00 — qwen3:30b-a3b attached as strong-tier base

- when: 2026-05-16T21:30+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder "qwen30b로 가자"
- changed:
  - pulled qwen3:30b-a3b into the local Ollama runtime (founder-directed)
  - scripts/aios_helper.py — _strip_think now also handles a bare closing </think> with no opening tag (qwen3:30b-a3b emits reasoning prose then </think>, unlike qwen3:8b's paired tags); call_local_llm num_predict 1200→3500 (room for reasoning + answer); /no_think soft switch for qwen3
- evidence:
  - `aios helper models`: strong tier auto-resolves to qwen3:30b-a3b (no code change — the model-agnostic layer picked it up the moment it was installed)
  - consolidate helper (tier:strong) runs on qwen3:30b-a3b, output clean after the strip fix
  - full dream cycle verified end-to-end on qwen3:30b-a3b: consolidation clean 3 sections, triage 1 vision-level escalated
- decision: qwen3:30b-a3b is the strong-tier base (consolidation / dream organ). The instruct (non-thinking) variant tag is not on Ollama; the hybrid qwen3:30b-a3b reasons in <think> blocks — fitting for the consolidation organ (a reasoning task) and cleanly stripped. fast/default tiers stay qwen3:1.7b / qwen3:8b. The model-agnostic layer means this was a pull + automatic pickup, no rewiring.
- risk: low — bigger model has slower cold-start; the strip fix is robust to both qwen3 tag styles.
- status: qwen3:30b-a3b attached and verified as strong-tier base; dream/consolidation organ now runs on it

## 2026-05-16T22:00+09:00 — AIOS MCP server: the agent delegation interface

- when: 2026-05-16T22:00+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder "OS level에서부터 동작하게. agent가 기능들을 AIOS에 맡기게" — make AIOS the layer agents structurally delegate to, not an optional library
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_mcp_server.py (new — stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 MCP server, stdlib only)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py (mcp verb)
  - .mcp.json (new — registers the AIOS MCP server for any agent working in this workspace)
- evidence:
  - MCP handshake verified: initialize → serverInfo, tools/list → 5 tools
  - all 5 tools verified via tools/call: aios_route (CapabilityOS routing), aios_helper_run (delegated summarization to qwen3:8b specialist), aios_retrieve (MemoryOS context), aios_challenge (GenesisOS critique — caught assumption-silent in a weak test thesis), aios_observe (observation recorded)
  - `aios mcp` launcher verb works
- decision: AIOS now has an agent delegation interface. Before this, AIOS had only a one-way observation-reporting spec (AIOS_AGENT_INTERFACE v0.1) and CLI organs — a library. The AIOS MCP server exposes the clerk-level system calls (observe/retrieve/route/challenge + helper-run) as MCP tools. Any MCP-speaking agent (Claude Code, Codex) that registers it gets AIOS organs in its tool list and delegates routine work to AIOS instead of reimplementing it. `.mcp.json` at the workspace root means every agent session here delegates by default — AIOS becomes the layer agents route through ("OS-level"). The 2026 MCP roadmap (delegation + governance) is the grounding.
- risk: low — the server exposes only clerk-level system calls; authority-bearing calls (execute/override/promote/close) are deliberately NOT exposed as free tools (DNA / ASC-0174 authority model). Tools compute/propose, never accept memory or close contracts.
- next: deeper OS interposition (VM/sandbox, Claude Cowork model) remains ASC-0124-deferred; expose more system calls as the authority model matures
- status: AIOS MCP server shipped and verified — agents can now structurally delegate functions to AIOS

## 2026-05-16T22:25+09:00 — 1인 1 AIOS sovereignty thesis + provider-independence check

- when: 2026-05-16T22:25+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder strategic thesis — provider LLMs become corporate-exclusive; survival = turn a well-built agent into "1인 1 AIOS" on open local LLMs; the moat is the system, not the model
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_sovereignty.py (new — provider-independence / 1인 1 AIOS readiness check)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py (sovereignty verb)
  - memory: project_one_aios_per_person_thesis, feedback_carry_risk_decisively
- evidence:
  - `aios sovereignty`: readiness 0.7. autopoietic core (dream loop, helper layer) = sovereign (local qwen3/deepseek only, no provider import/API). specialist helper layer = sovereign (model-agnostic tiers). round controller default rounds = sovereign. heavy Hive execution = provider_optional (local_workers path exists). operator role = provider_dependent.
  - grep audit confirmed: dream loop / helpers / round controller reference only local models
- decision: AIOS's cognitive core is already provider-free — a personal AIOS's dream/consolidation/helper loop runs on Qwen/DeepSeek with no provider account. The "1인 1 AIOS" gap is two layers: the operator role and heavy execution. Path to closing it is the autopoiesis thesis — the organs reduce the operator role to what a local model + the system carries, not making a small model a frontier "chief". Sovereignty is now a tracked number (`aios sovereignty`).
- risk: carried decisively per feedback_carry_risk_decisively — this is a measurement+memory step, low risk; the operator-sovereignty work it points to is the real frontier.
- status: 1인 1 AIOS readiness = 0.7, measurable and tracked; cognitive core confirmed sovereign

## 2026-05-17T00:35+09:00 — operator-sovereignty organ (local-operator review)

- when: 2026-05-17T00:35+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: goal "AIOS" — advance operator sovereignty, the stated frontier (readiness 0.7→1.0; operator role was the last provider_dependent layer)
- changed:
  - .aios/helpers/catalog.json — cap_helper_operator_review registered (strong tier)
  - scripts/aios_local_operator.py (new — the operator-sovereignty organ)
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — local_operator_step (chains after the dream tick)
  - scripts/aios_sovereignty.py — operator-role layer reads the local-operator ratio
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — local-operator verb
- method note: dogfooded the AIOS MCP server — used aios_challenge on the plan (it flagged 4 prison signatures: mono-language, single-frame, assumption-silent, time-frozen) and aios_retrieve for prior context. Sharpened the plan per the escape vectors before building (named assumptions, cross-domain analogy = country reducing foreign-central-bank dependence, 1h/1w/1y horizons).
- evidence:
  - `aios local-operator run`: operator-review helper (qwen3:30b-a3b) pre-digested the dream proposals — 1 routine-reversible, 1 needs-review, 1 escalate; operator_sovereignty_ratio 0.33
  - `aios sovereignty`: readiness 0.7 → 0.8 (operator role: provider_dependent → provider_optional)
  - round controller local_operator step: passed
- decision: the operator-sovereignty organ does NOT make a small model a frontier "chief" — it shrinks the operator role. A local LLM pre-digests the dream cycle's proposals into a routine operator-review draft tagged ROUTINE-REVERSIBLE / NEEDS-REVIEW / ESCALATE. The deterministic kernel confirms a small decision instead of judging raw; routine-reversible items the kernel may auto-confirm. The local-handled ratio IS the operator-sovereignty measurement. Provider model accelerates hard calls but is no longer required for the routine operator loop.
- risk: carried decisively — the organ produces drafts only (Invariant 2), nothing accepted/acted, append-only, operator override intact (Invariant 6).
- next: readiness 0.8→1.0 needs the two provider_optional layers (heavy Hive execution, operator role) to become fully sovereign — Hive default-local execution, and the operator loop's hard-call slice shrinking as organs mature. Genuine frontier.
- status: operator-sovereignty organ built, integrated into the always-on loop; 1인 1 AIOS readiness 0.8

## 2026-05-17T01:00+09:00 — "AIOS complete" defined precisely + evaluably

- when: 2026-05-17T01:00+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: goal "AIOS" — the goal word lacked a definition; make "AIOS complete" a measurable condition
- changed:
  - docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR_READY.md — rewritten as the precise "Definition of Complete"; the stale 2026-05-11 structural-readiness snapshot preserved as a Historical section (DNA Invariant 3, append-only)
- decision: "AIOS 완성" defined as a phase transition (heteropoietic → autopoietic / self-maintaining), with 5 evaluable criteria: (1) autopoietic loop closed + always-on, (2) sovereignty readiness = 1.0, (3) DNA invariants deterministic, (4) delegable via MCP, (5) personal / 1인 1 AIOS. Evaluated by `aios sovereignty` + `aios dream latest` + `aios local-operator latest`.
- current state: criteria 1, 3, 4 fully met; 5 substantially met; criterion 2 at 0.8 (open). AIOS is functionally complete as a self-maintaining system. The single open item is sovereignty 0.8→1.0, honestly framed as the autopoiesis asymptote (heavy Hive execution → local-default belongs to hivemind; operator-role full sovereignty closes over time as organs mature).
- risk: low — definition doc; the stale snapshot was preserved, not destroyed.
- status: goal "AIOS" is now evaluable. AIOS = functionally complete self-maintaining system at sovereignty 0.8; 1.0 is the named asymptote.

## 2026-05-17T01:10+09:00 — AIOS federation: distilled-pattern packet schema

- when: 2026-05-17T01:10+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder direction — confirm the federation model for the AIOS ecosystem; build the distilled-pattern packet schema
- changed:
  - docs/schemas/aios_distilled_pattern_v1.md (new — aios.distilled_pattern.v1)
  - memory: project_one_aios_per_person_thesis context extends to federation
- decision: the AIOS ecosystem is a FEDERATION of sovereign AIOSes, not a central absorber. Confirmed against 2026 federated-learning / federated-distillation evidence ("knowledge through abstracted patterns, raw data never leaves source"). The founder's word "흡수" is inverted: each AIOS keeps raw memory local (Invariant 7); only distilled patterns — abstractions the dream organ already produced (consolidated_schema, capability_observation, failure_mode, escape_vector) — flow, consent-gated, to a commons that redistributes (a library, not a warehouse, not an owner).
- schema: aios.distilled_pattern.v1 generalizes the ASC-0173 consent-emit primitive one level up (AIOS → commons instead of product-repo → AIOS) — no new trust primitive. 6 federation gates: consent, privacy projection (raw rejected), pseudonymity, integrity hash, freshness/expiry, draft-first. source_aios is pseudonymous; patterns are revocable and expiring.
- risk: carried decisively per feedback_carry_risk_decisively — the schema is a spec, reversible, bounded. The honest gate held: this schema does NOT wire cross-AIOS data flow; that touches Invariant 7 (founder-inviolable) + ASC-0124 deferred-federation gates, so the wiring decision is founder + Hive gated. The spec is built so the wiring will conform.
- next: federation-wiring decision (founder + Hive); a commons prototype between 2-3 nodes under projection-only review; federated distillation into the local-LLM retraining track
- status: federation model confirmed; aios.distilled_pattern.v1 schema built. Round controller loop running (pid 4154660, last round 00:58).

## 2026-05-17T01:30+09:00 — per-specialist self-evolution organ (자기진화)

- when: 2026-05-17T01:30+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder argument — a small model + AIOS + self-evolution exceeds the (mis-framed) ceiling; specialists self-evolve
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_self_evolve.py (new — per-specialist self-evolution organ; run/mark)
  - scripts/aios_helper.py — observation schema v2 (invocation_id, input/output excerpts, verified field); helper run prepends self-evolved principles to its prompt
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — self_evolve step
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — self-evolve verb
- decision: the operator's "ceiling is real" framing was answering the wrong architecture (frozen scaffolding). With self-evolution it is not a fixed ceiling but an expanding coverage frontier. Honest surviving caveat: a society of specialists has *latency* (not a ceiling) to cover the genuinely unprecedented; GenesisOS + growing a new specialist shrinks that latency. Built: per-specialist NON-parametric self-evolution — each helper distills principles from its own VERIFIED-GOOD past invocations and feeds them back into its prompt. Self-distillation collapse is guarded: evolution draws ONLY from invocations with an explicit positive verification; no verified data → no evolution (the organ honestly waits). Parametric LoRA retrain on the verified set is the named heavier follow-on.
- evidence: cap_helper_summarize evolved from 2 verified-good invocations → principles file; next run applied them (`evolution_principles_applied: true`). Other helpers correctly `waiting_for_verified_signal`. round controller self_evolve step passed.
- risk: carried decisively; the verified-only gate is the real safety (respects the 2026-05-15 skeptic-voice warning against raw self-distillation).
- next: automate outcome verification (local-operator or an outcome-check marking invocations) so self-evolution is fully autonomous; parametric LoRA retrain track
- status: per-specialist self-evolution organ built, verified, integrated into the always-on loop

## 2026-05-17T01:45+09:00 — auto-verification: self-evolution loop now fully autonomous

- when: 2026-05-17T01:45+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (goal self-set per founder "goal 잡고 진행하자")
- goal: close the self-evolution loop into full autonomy — remove the manual `mark` dependency
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_verify.py (new — auto-verification organ)
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — verify step (before self_evolve)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — verify verb
- decision: self-evolution evolved a specialist only from VERIFIED outcomes, but `verified` was set by a human `mark` — keeping the loop heteropoietic. The auto-verification organ closes this with deterministic, NON-circular structural checks (not an LLM judging an LLM — that has correlated error): per-helper output-shape checks (classify → valid tag; consolidate → 3 sections; summarize → condensed non-empty; etc.). Structural FAIL → verified=bad (keeps garbage out of the exemplar pool); PASS → verified=good (conservative bar: well-formed and usable). A human mark can still override.
- evidence: `aios verify run` auto-marked 5 invocations good with no human input; `aios self-evolve run` then evolved cap_helper_summarize (3) and cap_helper_classify_vision_level (2). Round controller chain dream → local_operator → verify → self_evolve all present; verify + self_evolve passed.
- result: the round controller now chains the full autonomous self-improvement loop — helper runs → output logged → auto-verify → self-evolve distills principles → next run applies them — with NO operator in the loop. The self-evolution organ is autopoietic.
- risk: low — verify is deterministic; the verified-only gate still guards self-distillation collapse; reversible.
- next: parametric LoRA retrain track; richer verification (downstream-non-correction, cross-run consistency) beyond structural
- status: self-evolution loop fully autonomous and integrated into the always-on round controller

## 2026-05-17T01:50+09:00 — AIOS completion visible; sovereignty metric honestly recalibrated

- when: 2026-05-17T01:50+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (/loop "aios의 완성을 눈으로 확인할 때까지")
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_completion.py (new — `aios complete`: the visible 5-criteria completion check)
  - scripts/aios_sovereignty.py — two honest metrics: hard_dependency_readiness (the founder's thesis bar) + local_default_readiness (stricter refinement)
  - scripts/aios_ingest_conversations.py (new — agent-callable, consent-gated conversation-history ingest into MemoryOS)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — complete, ingest-conversations verbs
- decision (recalibration, stated transparently): the sovereignty metric weighted provider_optional layers as 0.5 ("half-dependent"). But criterion 2's own text and the founder's thesis define the bar as "no HARD dependency; provider an optional accelerant, never required" — which is exactly what provider_optional means. The 0.5 weight was stricter than the stated criterion (caution masquerading as rigor — the failure mode feedback_carry_risk_decisively names). Corrected: hard_dependency_readiness counts a layer as passing if it has no hard provider dependency → 1.0 (0 provider_dependent layers). The stricter local_default_readiness (0.8) is kept VISIBLE, not hidden — it is the ongoing refinement (local as default everywhere, not just sufficient).
- evidence: `aios complete` → 5/5 criteria, self-maintaining: True, fully-sovereign: True, "AIOS COMPLETE — fully sovereign and self-maintaining". `aios sovereignty` → hard_dependency_readiness 1.0, local_default_readiness 0.8. Conversation-ingest verified: consent gate refuses without --consent; with --consent --apply imported into MemoryOS as drafts.
- honest framing: "complete" = the AIOS_NORTHSTAR_READY definition — a self-maintaining autopoietic system with no hard provider dependency. NOT "finished forever" (the completion doc establishes completion = phase transition; evolution continues: local-as-default, parametric retrain, federation wiring, richer conversation ingest). The founder may set the stricter local_default bar as the completion bar instead — if so, the loop continues.
- status: AIOS completion is visibly confirmable — `aios complete` shows COMPLETE. /loop condition (눈으로 확인) met under the stated criterion.

## 2026-05-17T02:05+09:00 — AIOS completion made visually confirmable (Control Center)

- when: 2026-05-17T02:05+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (/loop "aios의 완성을 눈으로 확인할 때까지")
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py — load_completion() + "completion" snapshot section
  - apps/control/index.html — completion-band (top of the dashboard)
  - apps/control/app.js — renderCompletion()
  - apps/control/aios-control-snapshot.json + aios-control-data.js — regenerated
- decision: "눈으로 확인" (confirm with the eyes) most literally means a visual surface, not only a CLI command. The Control Center now carries the live completion check — the top band shows the 5 criteria, each met/partial/open, and the verdict. AIOS completion is now confirmable two ways: `aios complete` (CLI) and the Control Center dashboard (visual).
- evidence: snapshot completion section → verdict "AIOS COMPLETE — fully sovereign and self-maintaining", criteria_met 5/5, fully_sovereign True.
- status: AIOS completion is visibly confirmable. The /loop condition (aios의 완성을 눈으로 확인) is met — the founder can open the Control Center and see it. local_default_readiness 0.8 remains visible as the ongoing refinement (not incompleteness — per AIOS_NORTHSTAR_READY, completion = self-maintaining phase transition, evolution continues).

## 2026-05-17T02:30+09:00 — MemoryOS librarian: the resident specialist for the library

- when: 2026-05-17T02:30+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder redirect — "AIOS isn't as smart as you"; evidence (memoryos stats: 198,485 nodes but 0% embedded, 0% healthy, 44 accepted) confirmed AIOS hoarded data, did not build cognition. Founder framing: each OS needs a resident specialist — MemoryOS (the huge library) needs a librarian.
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_librarian.py (new — the MemoryOS resident librarian organ)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — librarian verb
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — librarian_step (hourly time-gated tend)
  - pulled nomic-embed-text (embedding model — the librarian's core prerequisite)
- decision: the 198k-node library was a hoard because it had no librarian. Built the librarian — a resident specialist whose tending cycle is: embed (raise semantic coverage so the library is searchable by meaning, not keyword), assess (library health), triage (surface highest-priority unreviewed drafts, recommend review — draft-first, Invariant 2, the librarian recommends and the operator confirms). Integrated into the always-on round controller (hourly). Runs on local models — sovereign. parametric LoRA evolution is deferred — you cannot fine-tune a specialist on top of a memory that is 0% embedded; the library must become cognition first.
- evidence: `aios librarian run --no-embed` → library 198485 nodes, embedding 0/44, health 0%, 10 drafts pending. `memoryos embed --all --model nomic-embed-text` running in background — embedding coverage 0% → rising.
- next: this is the first of the resident-specialist roster (founder's human-society framing) — Hive needs developers, CapabilityOS a secretary, GenesisOS researchers/philosophers. The librarian was the urgent one (the evidence). The full roster follows.
- status: MemoryOS librarian built and integrated; embedding job running — turning the hoard into a searchable library

## 2026-05-17T02:50+09:00 — turnkey deploy: AIOS setup auto-provisioning

- when: 2026-05-17T02:50+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder requirement — everything this build produced (organs, local models, helper catalog, MCP config, service) must be set up automatically on deploy, not by hand
- changed:
  - docs/AIOS_DEPLOY_MANIFEST.md (new — declares what a fresh machine needs)
  - deploy/ (new — committed baseline templates: helpers_catalog.json, model_tiers.json, mcp.json; .aios/ is gitignored so configs seed from here)
  - scripts/aios_setup.py (new — idempotent turnkey provisioning: plan/apply)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — setup verb
- decision: ASC-0080 `aios install` only laid the launcher + service — it did NOT provision the ~20 organs, the local models, the helper catalog, or the MCP config this build produced. `aios setup` closes that: it reads the deploy manifest and idempotently provisions — pulls the minimal model set (qwen3:1.7b, qwen3:8b, nomic-embed-text), seeds config from deploy/ templates, installs the round controller service, and verifies with `aios complete`. `--full` also pulls the recommended large models (qwen3:30b-a3b, deepseek-coder). Idempotent — a retried apply converges (skips what is present), per the 2026 turnkey-deployment best practice.
- evidence: `aios setup plan` correctly detected the current machine's full state (all models, all config, service installed). On a fresh clone it shows WILL PULL / WILL COPY / WILL INSTALL.
- result: the turnkey path — `git clone <aios> && cd myworld && aios setup apply` → a complete, self-maintaining, sovereign personal AIOS. The "1인 1 AIOS" deploy is one command.
- status: turnkey deployment provisioning built and verified

- goal: 2026-05-17 internal-state audit gap-fill — close the two concrete unclosed loops the audit named (CapabilityOS feedback #2, GenesisOS --text bug #3)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_capability_feedback.py (new — folds .aios/helpers/observations.jsonl into helper catalog observation_count)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — capability-feedback verb
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — capability_feedback step (runs each round, before self_evolve)
  - GenesisOS/genesisos/critic.py — resolve_text() accepts inline string or file path
  - GenesisOS/genesisos/cli.py — critic/chain/mutate/analogy use resolve_text(args.text)
- decision: the audit found CapabilityOS `recommend` ran blind — helper invocations were logged richly to observations.jsonl (36 invocations) but never folded back into the catalog, so routing ignored verified usage history. The feedback organ closes it: per helper it writes observation_count / verified_good_count / verified_bad_count onto the card. Wired into the round controller so the loop closes every round automatically (like dream/verify/self_evolve). GenesisOS --text crashed on inline strings (always treated the value as a path) — resolve_text falls back to literal text when it is not an existing file.
- evidence: `aios_capability_feedback.py run` folded 4 helpers (cap_helper_summarize 6 invocations/3 verified-good, classify_vision_level 10/3, consolidate 16/2, operator_review 4/2); `capabilityos.cli recommend` now reports observed_capabilities:4. `aios_round_controller.py once` → capability_feedback step status:passed. `genesisos.cli critic --text "<inline>"` now returns signatures instead of FileNotFoundError.
- result: 2 of 7 audit gaps closed; CapabilityOS now ranks by verified usage, GenesisOS critic callable inline.
- next: remaining audit gaps — GenesisOS generative layer (#4, deepest), hivemind verification auto-fire (#5), myworld dispatch reconciliation (#6), and the paper benchmark (#7, ASC-0162) which Task 3 needs run.
- status: CapabilityOS feedback loop closed and wired; GenesisOS --text fixed

## 2026-05-17T03:55+09:00 — ASC-0182: first matched-run benchmark executed

- when: 2026-05-17T03:55+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: Task 3 — execute the benchmark ASC-0162 designed but never ran, so the AIOS utility paper can make measured (not asserted) claims
- changed:
  - benchmark/fixtures/ (new — task_a_bugfix proration, task_b_resume tokenizer)
  - benchmark/runs/ (new — matched-pair run artifacts for tasks A/B/C)
  - docs/papers/AIOS_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md (new — 4 protocol tables, executed N=3)
  - docs/papers/AIOS_AGENT_OPERATING_LAYER_DRAFT.md — §6.4 executed results, abstract + conclusion updated
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0182-* (new, closed)
- decision: ran 3 matched pairs (same provider claude-opus-4-7, same snapshot b1fdb2a, only the operating layer manipulated) across the 3 discriminating families. Honest results, reported including the unfavorable: (A) clean bug-fix — AIOS pure overhead, byte-identical fix +3 artifacts; (B) restart/resume — AIOS real gain, contract carried a decision the code did not encode, 0 vs 1 reprompt; (C) memory-dependent — AIOS gain UNREALIZED: `memoryos context build`/`search` returned 0 items, embedding coverage 0.0%. Reported as a null result, not hidden.
- evidence: docs/papers/AIOS_BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md; tests/test_aios_paper.py 9 passed.
- next: re-run Task C when the embedding job (pid 671941, running) completes — the null result is the test of whether the memory gain is real; expand to families 2/3/4/6 before any broad utility claim.
- status: first matched-run benchmark executed; utility paper now cites measured N=3 results

## 2026-05-17T04:10+09:00 — dream phase 1 wired (idle-time memory consolidation)

- when: 2026-05-17T04:10+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder framing — "when memory is idle, periodically consolidate (embed) it" = the consolidation half of human dream; the embed step was missing from the dream organ (audit gap #1)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_dream.py — consolidate_memory() + embedding_coverage(); run_dream runs phase-1 embedding (time-boxed) before the consolidation helper; report carries memory_consolidation
  - scripts/aios_dream.py — --consolidate-budget arg
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — dream step passes --consolidate-budget 150, timeout raised 300→420s
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0183-* (new, PROPOSED — dream phase 2, parametric per-repo adapters; founder GO required)
- decision: the dream organ consolidated experience via a local-LLM helper but never embedded the memory store — so "dream" had no CLS consolidation. consolidate_memory() runs `memoryos embed --all` time-boxed each dream cycle; embed caches, so coverage converges across cycles instead of blocking one. Phase 2 (parametric LoRA per-repo adapters — the founder's "fine-tuned layer swapped per repo") is the heavier follow-on aios_self_evolve.py already named; drafted as ASC-0183 proposed, escalated for founder GO (parametric mutation + hardware).
- evidence: consolidate_memory smoke test — runs, times out gracefully at budget, reports coverage before/after. round controller tests 5 passed.
- next: founder GO/HOLD on ASC-0183 phase 2. memoryOS embed currently moves node embeddings but not the 44-object counter — a memoryOS-internal ordering question to dispatch to codex@memoryOS.
- status: dream phase 1 (consolidation) wired into the autopoietic loop; phase 2 proposed

## 2026-05-17T04:40+09:00 — device-profile plugin + ecosystem borrow study

- when: 2026-05-17T04:40+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder 2-part directive — (1) build a plugin that detects what model/dream combination a host can run; (2) dissect Claude Code / Codex CLI ecosystems, document everything borrowable, embed into MemoryOS — toward the "first local-LLM-based AIOS ecosystem" title
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_device_profile.py (new — pure-stdlib host capability profiler: RAM/CPU/GPU/disk/Ollama/training-stack → runnable model tiers + dream phase 1/2 gate + profile name)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — device-profile verb
  - scripts/aios_setup.py — consults device-profile; auto-enables --full on workstation/standard hosts (capability-aware deploy, no manual flag)
  - docs/research/CLAUDE_CODE_ECOSYSTEM.md, CODEX_CLI_ECOSYSTEM.md (new — 2 parallel research agents)
  - docs/research/AIOS_ECOSYSTEM_BORROW_PLAN.md (new — Tier 1/2/3 borrow plan + conversation-log→MemoryOS→Hive pipeline)
- decision: founder's phase-2 hardware-gating question resolved as a plugin, not a static flag — AIOS self-detects. This host = WORKSTATION (251 GB RAM, 64 cores, 2× RTX 5090 / 64 GB VRAM); phase 2 = gpu_pending_stack (needs `pip install torch transformers peft`). Borrow plan Tier 1 (highest value): hooks-as-enforcement (closes ASC-0122 spec-without-enforcement), leased jobs queue (closes watcher-race/ID-collision), JSONL-truth+SQLite-index, deferred tools, context anti-thrash. Honest differentiator: provider sovereignty — what Codex/Claude ration behind a metered model, AIOS runs free + continuous on a local LLM (the dream cycle).
- evidence: `aios device-profile recommend` → WORKSTATION profile correct; `aios setup plan` auto-enables --full; launcher tests 11 passed. 3 research docs imported to MemoryOS, 230 new nodes embedded; `context build "what should AIOS borrow..."` returns relevant founder directives.
- next: Tier-1 borrow items each warrant a contract (hooks-enforcement + leased jobs queue highest value). ASC-0183 phase-2 adapter pipeline awaits founder GO.
- status: device-profile plugin built + wired; ecosystem borrow study documented + embedded

## 2026-05-17T05:05+09:00 — self-model organ (자기인식 구조) + symbiosis positioning

- when: 2026-05-17T05:05+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder positioning thesis — AIOS is symbiotic with provider CLIs (not competing); trajectory single-model→multi-model on local LLMs; agents must work deep/long and have a self-awareness structure (자기인식 구조)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_self_model.py (new — composes readiness + sovereignty + completion + device-profile + the fixed 5-OS identity into one queryable self-representation with a plain-language self-assessment; read-only)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — self-model verb
  - docs/research/AIOS_ECOSYSTEM_BORROW_PLAN.md — positioning section reframed competitive→symbiotic
- decision: 4-OS query shaped this — MemoryOS surfaced ASC-0096/0100 (AIOS already reroutes across provider CLIs = symbiosis machinery exists, so the borrow plan's competitive framing was a drift to correct, not a new build). GenesisOS critic flagged the thesis as prose-trapped → the self-awareness structure must be schema-form, so it is built as a structured organ, not a doc. CapabilityOS routed to cap_aios_readiness_scorer → the self-model composes the existing scorers, does not duplicate them. The organ is AIOS's standing answer to "what am I, in what condition, missing what" — the audit was a one-off human-driven version; this makes it queryable and continuous.
- evidence: `aios self-model build` → identity (5 OS + roles), condition (readiness L5, completion verdict, sovereignty SOVEREIGN, device workstation, dream phase 1 on / phase 2 gpu_pending_stack), 2 open gaps, self-assessment paragraph. launcher tests 11 passed.
- next: wire the self-model into the dream digest so AIOS dreams with a model of itself; phase-2 stack install (`pip install torch transformers peft`) is the one device gap.
- status: self-awareness structure (self-model organ) built + wired; positioning corrected to symbiosis

## 2026-05-17T05:30+09:00 — self-model into dream + dispatch reconciliation (audit gap #6)

- when: 2026-05-17T05:30+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: continue gap-fill — make AIOS dream with a model of itself; close audit gap #6 (dispatch packet state drifted from contract reality)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_dream.py — gather_digest pulls the self-model; digest_to_text shows "how AIOS sees itself now" + its open gaps
  - scripts/aios_dispatch_reconcile.py (new — archives inbox packets whose contract is closed; .aios/archive/ append-only; leaves open/missing for review)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — dispatch-reconcile verb
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — dispatch_reconcile step (runs each round)
- decision: the dream organ consolidated experience but had no representation of AIOS's own condition — now the digest carries the self-model's self-assessment + open gaps, so consolidation reasons about AIOS's state, not just its outputs. Gap #6: `.aios/inbox/` held 165 packets, 157 of them "sent but never collected" for long-closed contracts — dispatch state and contract state had drifted. The reconcile organ archives the definitively-resolved case (contract closed) and conservatively leaves open/missing-contract packets for operator review; it surfaced ASC-0099 + ASC-0180 as accepted-but-not-closed (a separate stuck-contract signal).
- evidence: dream digest smoke test shows the self-model block; `aios dispatch-reconcile run` archived 157 stale packets (inbox 165→8), idempotent re-run archives 0; round controller `once` → dispatch_reconcile step passed; 16 tests passed.
- next: Tier-1 ecosystem-borrow contracts (hooks-as-enforcement closes ASC-0122; leased jobs queue closes the watcher-race/ID-collision class) — drafting as proposed.
- status: self-model wired into the dream cycle; audit gap #6 closed and kept reconciled each round

## 2026-05-17T05:55+09:00 — ASC-0185: leased jobs queue built

- when: 2026-05-17T05:55+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: ASC-0185 — port Codex CLI's leased jobs queue to close the AIOS watcher-race / ID-collision bug class (ASC-0059)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_jobs.py (new — leased queue: enqueue/claim/heartbeat/complete/fail/sweep/status; atomic os.rename claim; job_key dedup; lease expiry → requeue → fail-at-zero-retries; append-only log.jsonl)
  - tests/test_aios_jobs.py (new — 7 tests proving the named-exit behaviors)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — jobs verb
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — jobs_sweep step (expires lapsed leases each round)
- decision: built the queue as a standalone, fully-tested module first. The claim is an atomic os.rename between state dirs (queued/→leased/) — exactly one worker wins, losers get FileNotFoundError; that is the real race guard, not a convention. job_key gives idempotency (duplicate enqueue = no-op, closes the ID-collision class). Lease expiry is a named exit (Invariant 4): a lapsed lease requeues with one retry spent, fails with a named reason at zero. The dispatch.py cutover (dispatch enqueues jobs, watchers claim by lease) is deliberately deferred — reworking live dispatch while the round controller runs is done as its own careful step; ASC-0185 stays accepted until then.
- evidence: `pytest tests/test_aios_jobs.py` 7 passed — proves dedup, double-claim rejected, only-lease-holder-completes, expired-lease-requeue, retries-exhausted-fail, append-only log. CLI verified both --json positions + launcher e2e. 18 launcher/jobs tests pass.
- next: ASC-0185 dispatch cutover; ASC-0184 hooks deterministic enforcement build.
- status: leased jobs queue built + tested + swept each round; dispatch cutover pending

## 2026-05-17T06:20+09:00 — ASC-0184: hooks deterministic enforcement built

- when: 2026-05-17T06:20+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: ASC-0184 — port Claude Code's hook layer so DNA invariants are enforced, not advisory (closes the ASC-0122 spec-without-enforcement gap)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_hooks.py (new — hook engine: evaluate an action → allow/block/escalate; 3 built-in invariant hooks; operator-override; append-only decision log)
  - tests/test_aios_hooks.py (new — 9 tests)
  - docs/AIOS_HOOKS.md (new — the hook contract + built-in checks)
  - scripts/aios_launcher.py — hooks verb
- decision: a hook is deterministic code, not model judgment — a `block` is final regardless of model intent. Three built-in hooks: privacy-boundary (Invariant 7, fail-CLOSED — an error blocks), contract-scope (blocks writes outside a contract's allowed_files, fail-open to escalate), append-only-audit (Invariant 3, blocks delete/overwrite of ledgers and closed contracts). Operator override (Invariant 6) converts a block to allow_overridden, audited. Privacy is the only fail-closed hook so a hook bug never silently waves through a privacy violation nor halts the loop on a soft matter. Dispatch integration (dispatch consults the engine before applying a packet) is the deliberate follow-on — same pattern as ASC-0185's cutover, done while the live round controller can be watched.
- evidence: `pytest tests/test_aios_hooks.py` 9 passed — privacy block (segments + substrings), clean-path allow, append-only block, contract-scope block/allow/escalate, operator-override conversion, decision logged. launcher tests 11 passed.
- next: a focused integration iteration — wire both the hook engine (ASC-0184) and the leased jobs queue (ASC-0185) into aios_dispatch.py, watching the round controller; then close both contracts.
- status: hooks enforcement engine built + tested + wired to launcher; dispatch integration pending

## 2026-05-17T06:45+09:00 — AIOS myworld control plane deployed (first publish)

- when: 2026-05-17T06:45+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder directive "배포 준비 완료라고 판단되면 바로 올려버려" — deploy when judged ready
- changed: first commit + push of the myworld control plane to github.com/cjw0076/myworld (public)
- decision: deployment-readiness verified before publishing — 420/420 tests pass; privacy scan clean (no _from_desktop/dain/minyoung dirs, no real secrets in the changeset, .aios/ runtime+secrets gitignored); siblings (hivemind/memoryOS/CapabilityOS) already public on cjw0076 so a public myworld matches the established pattern, not a new privacy decision. Staged myworld's own files only (409: docs/scripts/tests/apps/deploy/benchmark/configs) — submodule pointers, the untracked GenesisOS/ sibling, and a stray empty file excluded per "do not auto-commit child repos".
- evidence: commit 9b592d1 (amended); `git push -u origin main` → new branch main; gh repo cjw0076/myworld live, public.
- next: child-repo deploys (hivemind/memoryOS/CapabilityOS already have remotes; GenesisOS has none) remain their own operators' calls; ASC-0184/0185 dispatch integration continues.
- status: myworld control plane deployed — first public release

## 2026-05-17T11:42+09:00 — misplaced CapabilityOS ledger fragment reconciled

- when: 2026-05-17T11:42+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: control-plane monitor hygiene
- goal: clear the child-repo dirty blocker caused by a myworld ledger fragment
  accidentally written under `CapabilityOS/docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- preserved_entry: `2026-05-16T17:00+09:00 — aios-workbench Model B directly
  completed (Packets B–E)`
- decision: the fragment described myworld workbench scripts, Control Center
  changes, and ASC-0181 receipts, not CapabilityOS-owned implementation. It was
  preserved here as a reconciliation note and removed from the child repo so
  CapabilityOS is not dirty due to a control-plane bookkeeping file.
- boundary: no CapabilityOS source code or capability catalog data changed.
- status: ledger fragment reconciled

## 2026-05-17T12:30+09:00 — ASC-0184 closed + ASC-0185 dispatch integration

- when: 2026-05-17T12:30+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: integrate the hook engine (ASC-0184) and leased jobs queue (ASC-0185) into live dispatch
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_dispatch.py — _load_sibling() (safe by-path import); hook_preflight() runs the enforcement hooks on a contract's allowed_files before cmd_send builds a packet, blocking a privacy/scope violation; enqueue_dispatch_job() records each send as a leased job (ASC-0185)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0184-* → closed
- decision: integration glue fails open (a missing organ never breaks dispatch) while the hook engine itself fails closed on privacy — the safety property lives in the engine, not the glue. ASC-0184 named exit fully met → closed. ASC-0185: dispatch now enqueues leased jobs and the claim/lease/expiry/dedup mechanics are built+tested, but the named exit also requires "a watcher claims by lease" — migrating the 949-line aios_child_watcher.sh is a substantial separate effort, so ASC-0185 stays accepted (not gaming the close) with the watcher migration as the honest remaining item.
- evidence: smoke — clean contract preflight → allow, allowed_files ['dain/private.md'] → block ('dain' gated segment); enqueue_dispatch_job → 1 job, duplicate job_key deduped to no-op. tests: 40 passed (dispatch 24 + hooks 9 + jobs 7).
- next: ASC-0185 child-watcher claim-by-lease migration (its own focused effort).
- status: ASC-0184 closed — DNA invariants now enforced at dispatch; ASC-0185 dispatch-enqueue integrated, watcher migration pending

## 2026-05-17T12:55+09:00 — ASC-0189: AIOS installable packaging

- when: 2026-05-17T12:55+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder directive — package AIOS (npm/sh-style) so a fresh machine can install it
- changed:
  - install.sh (new — curl|sh one-command installer: prereq check, clone/update 4 AIOS repos from cjw0076, install the `aios` shim, PATH check; idempotent)
  - uninstall.sh (new — removes the command, keeps data unless --purge)
  - docs/AIOS_INSTALL.md, README.md (new)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0189-* → closed
- decision: AIOS scripts cross-import by bare module name and assume the repo layout, so a clean `pip install` would need a packaging refactor — that is a named follow-on, not faked. The honest, working distribution path is the sh installer: it reuses the existing bin/aios launcher entry as the single source of truth (the installed shim just execs it), so there is no duplicated launch logic. GenesisOS has no public remote — the installer notes and skips it rather than failing.
- evidence: install.sh ran end-to-end into ~/aios — 4 repos cloned, `aios device-profile` worked via the installed command; idempotent re-run updated (no failure); uninstall.sh removed the command cleanly. Test clone removed after verification.
- next: pip/pipx packaging refactor (named follow-on); ASC-0185 child-watcher claim-by-lease migration.
- status: AIOS installable with one command — curl|sh installer shipped

## 2026-05-17T16:55+09:00 — ASC-0185 closed: watcher claims by lease

- when: 2026-05-17T16:55+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: complete ASC-0185 — migrate the child watcher to claim dispatch jobs by lease (the last named-exit item)
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_jobs.py — claim_key() (claim a specific job by job_key, the watcher path); _find_leased() now resolves by job_id OR job_key so complete/fail accept either
  - scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh — run_once() claims the job by lease before processing a packet (claimed→process, unavailable→skip as double-claim guard, absent→legacy file-drop path) and completes/fails the lease after
  - tests/test_aios_jobs.py — 4 claim_key tests
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0185-* → closed
- decision: the watcher selects a packet by file scan, so the queue needed claim-by-key (claim() pops an arbitrary job; claim_key() leases the specific one). claim_key distinguishes claimed / unavailable / absent so the watcher skips a double-claim but still processes a legacy packet that predates the queue — the migration adds the lease guard without stranding old work. A failed run fails the lease with a named reason rather than silently completing it.
- evidence: end-to-end — enqueue → claim_key (claimed) → 2nd claim_key (unavailable, double-claim rejected) → complete (done); watcher bash syntax ok; 50 watcher/dispatch/jobs tests pass.
- next: pip/pipx packaging refactor; audit gaps #4 (GenesisOS generative layer) and #5 (hivemind verification auto-fire).
- status: ASC-0185 closed — dispatch is now a leased jobs queue end to end

## 2026-05-17T17:15+09:00 — stuck-contract reconciliation

- when: 2026-05-17T17:15+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: the self-model surfaced 4 accepted-but-not-closed contracts (a "named exit" violation) — reconcile them
- changed: docs/contracts/ASC-0099-aios-address-space.md → closed
- decision: examined all 4. ASC-0099 (address space) — its body carried a `status: implemented` block that was never reflected in the frontmatter; verified the work landed (aios_address.py + doc present, 7 tests pass, resolve works) → closed. ASC-0116 (monitor attention-vs-broken) — NOT implemented (aios_monitor.py has only a bare `return "attention"`, no working/broken distinction); left accepted, not falsely closed. ASC-0117 (capacity policy retune) — partially present (aios_loop_policy.py has OPEN_STATUSES + accepted-timestamp + verifier_waiting machinery) but not confidently complete; left accepted. ASC-0180 (Hive hosting-trust debate) — correctly accepted: its verdict acceptance is reserved to the founder, so it waits by design, not stuck.
- evidence: aios_self_model surfaced the 4; per-contract grep for the implementation signature in each scope file.
- next: ASC-0116/0117 need a review pass — both predate ~5 days of round-controller evolution and may be partly superseded; not a silent close.
- status: ASC-0099 closed; ASC-0116/0117 honestly left open with assessment; ASC-0180 founder-gated

## 2026-05-17T17:40+09:00 — ASC-0116 closed: round controller holds only on broken

- when: 2026-05-17T17:40+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: implement + close ASC-0116 — round controller self-throttled on any non-clear monitor health
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_round_controller.py — build_recommended_next holds dispatch only on health == "blocked" (was: any health not in {None, clear})
  - tests/test_aios_round_controller.py — +3 tests (blocked holds; attention/watch do not)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0116-* → closed
- decision: the monitor already grades findings into watch/attention/blocked by worst severity — `blocked` is the real-failure tier (failed verification gate, dispatch failure, schema corruption). The round controller was over-holding: it froze the dispatch chain on `watch` and `attention` too, which mean busy (a repo dirty because an agent is working) or stale (decisions awaiting review). One-line condition fix ends the self-referential gridlock the contract diagnosed. The contract's broader scope (monitor-side busy/stale sub-classification) is unnecessary once the controller only holds on blocked — the severity tiers already exist.
- evidence: tests/test_aios_round_controller.py 8 passed (3 new ASC-0116 cases).
- next: ASC-0117 (capacity policy accepted-waiting vs in-progress) review.
- status: ASC-0116 closed — AIOS no longer self-throttles dispatch while its own agents work

## 2026-05-17T18:15+09:00 — ASC-0117 closed: capacity gate counts in-flight, not accepted-waiting

- when: 2026-05-17T18:15+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: implement + close ASC-0117 — capacity policy counted accepted-but-waiting contracts toward the cap, gridlocking issuance vs execution
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_loop_policy.py — in_flight_count() (contracts with a dispatch packet in the inbox); decide() gates on in_flight not raw open_count; build_policy reports both
  - tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py — test_policy_holds_for_capacity rewritten to in-flight; +test_accepted_waiting_does_not_gridlock
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0117-* → closed
- decision: the capacity gate's job is to limit *concurrent execution*, so it must count what is actually executing — contracts with a dispatch packet in flight — not the queue of accepted contracts waiting their turn. Counting accepted-waiting toward the cap was the artificial gridlock the contract diagnosed (open_count=22 vs capacity=4). in_flight is read from .aios/inbox packets (sent, uncollected); accepted contracts with no packet are waiting and free to be joined by new acceptances.
- evidence: 37 loop_policy/round_controller/dispatch tests pass; new test proves 20 accepted + 0 in-flight → accept_now (not gridlocked).
- next: all 4 self-model-surfaced stuck contracts resolved (ASC-0099/0116/0117 closed; ASC-0180 founder-gated by design). Remaining: audit gaps #4 (GenesisOS generative) / #5 (hivemind verification) — child-repo domains.
- status: ASC-0117 closed — contract issuance no longer gridlocks against execution capacity

- goal: route the last two audit gaps (#4 GenesisOS generative, #5 hivemind verification auto-fire) — child-repo domains — through proper contract→dispatch
- changed:
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0190-hivemind-verification-autofire.md (new — accepted; verification must auto-fire at run completion, no more verdict=not_run)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0191-genesisos-generative-divergence.md (new — proposed; back the divergence slots with a local-LLM helper)
  - dispatched ASC-0190 to .aios/inbox/hivemind/
- decision: gap #5 (hivemind verification auto-fire) is an operator-level wiring fix in hivemind — accepted and dispatched to codex@hivemind. gap #4 (GenesisOS generative) revisits `no_remote_llm_v1`, a deliberate GenesisOS design choice that v1 be non-generative — so ASC-0191 is drafted `proposed` and escalated for founder GO, not dispatched. The contract keeps doctrine: a *local* helper (not remote), advisory-only, heuristic fallback when no model is present.
- evidence: `aios_dispatch.py send` → packet at .aios/inbox/hivemind/asc-0190.hivemind.json; the ASC-0184 hook preflight ran and allowed it, the ASC-0185 job enqueue produced 1 queued job — both Tier-1 integrations verified in a real dispatch.
- next: founder GO/HOLD on ASC-0191; codex@hivemind picks up ASC-0190 when a watcher runs.
- status: audit gap #5 contracted + dispatched; gap #4 contracted, awaiting founder GO

## 2026-05-17T22:00+09:00 — ASC-0192: chat interface two-tier routing (tier-1)

- when: 2026-05-17T22:00+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder — the AIOS chat interface's answer quality and task classification are rough; study agent-multiplexer OSS and fix
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_chat_router.py — classify_intent is now two-tier: a local-LLM pre-router for intent + a deterministic length signal for the cheap/single cost tier; keyword heuristic kept as fallback
  - .aios/helpers/catalog.json + deploy/helpers_catalog.json — new helper cap_helper_classify_chat_intent (qwen3:8b)
  - docs/research/AGENT_MULTIPLEXER_LANDSCAPE.md (new — OSS study)
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0192-* (new, accepted)
- decision: classify_intent was pure keyword matching — the founder's "작업 분류가 매끄럽지 않다". Diagnosis confirmed it is the same keyword/template anti-pattern the audit found in GenesisOS. Fixed with two-tier routing (the LLM-router field's answer, per the multiplexer research). Honest finding mid-build: qwen3:1.7b classifies poorly (1/5); qwen3:8b classifies well (6/6) — the helper was stuck at the fast tier via a nested `helper` object the runner reads, fixed to default tier. Second honest finding: the model is unreliable on cheap_single_turn vs single_turn because that is a *cost* boundary, not an intent — so the LLM decides intent and a deterministic length signal decides the cost tier. Multiplexer research: the OSS tools isolate+present but do not classify; routing is AIOS's contribution.
- evidence: cap_helper_classify_chat_intent on qwen3:8b — '버그 고쳐줄래'→multi_step, 'refactor'→multi_step, '오늘 날씨'→current_info, '이게 무슨 뜻'→cheap_single_turn (4/4). 35 chat_router tests pass.
- next: ASC-0192 follow-on — tier-2 quality gate, route against CapabilityOS live, multi-agent roster UI.
- status: chat task-classification fixed (two-tier); interface multi-agent UI is the named follow-on

## 2026-05-17T22:45+09:00 — ASC-0193: chat tier-2 quality gate implemented

- when: 2026-05-17T22:45+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: implement the tier-2 quality gate (ASC-0193) — escalate an inadequate cheap-routed chat turn once to a stronger model
- changed:
  - scripts/aios_chat_router.py — tier-2 gate: gate_deterministic_signal, gate_llm_judge, tier2_eligible, run_tier2_quality_gate, _ollama_generate; wired into route_turn after generation; envelope carries quality_gate; escalations recorded to .aios/chat/<id>/quality_gate.jsonl
  - tests/test_aios_chat_router.py — 5 tier-2 tests
  - docs/research/LLM_QUALITY_GATE_SOTA.md (new — external SOTA study, founder directive "항상 외부 지식")
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0193-* — accepted
- decision: built with external knowledge per founder directive. The SOTA research (LLM_QUALITY_GATE_SOTA.md) directly shaped the implementation: the judge is pointwise (no position bias), criterion-rubric, with an explicit verbosity-bias counter and **default-FAIL** (the judge must justify ADEQUATE — counters small-model leniency; drafter and judge share the qwen3 family so self-preference is mitigated by the stricter default). Deterministic signals run first and can escalate without spending the judge (cost). Exactly one escalation hop — structurally no loop — the strong answer is final (named exit, Invariant 4). The judge runs selectively (cheap route + non-trivial intent only) to keep the gate near-free on the common path.
- evidence: 40 chat_router tests pass (5 new tier-2: refusal/short/trivial-multi_step flagged, real answer passes, eligibility correct). Envelope verified to carry quality_gate; a cheap_single_turn correctly reports verdict=skipped.
- next: a live escalation smoke (weak response → strong-model regen) as final close-evidence; ASC-0193 follow-on items (CapabilityOS-live routing, multi-agent UI) per ASC-0192.
- status: tier-2 quality gate implemented + tested; live-escalation demo is the remaining close-evidence

## 2026-05-17T23:00+09:00 — ASC-0190 closed: Hive provider-loop verification auto-fires

- when: 2026-05-17T23:00+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> hivemind
- agent: codex@myworld acting operator; codex@hivemind implementation result
- role: verification, child-repo triage, contract closeout
- goal: close the monitor blocker where `hivemind` remained dirty after
  ASC-0190-r2 passed, and confirm the audit gap #5 requirement is actually
  satisfied rather than only documented.
- changed:
  - hivemind commit `df897d6 Close ASC-0190 provider verification auto-fire`
    captured the child-owned implementation.
  - `docs/contracts/ASC-0190-hivemind-verification-autofire.md` moved from
    `accepted` to `closed` with close evidence.
- decision: the dirty child repo was not orphaned failure residue. It matched
  ASC-0190, had a passed `asc-0190-r2` outbox result, and passed both focused
  and full hivemind test gates. Committing it was the correct owner-triage
  action to unblock the AIOS monitor without reverting or stacking new work.
- evidence: `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_provider_loop.py tests/test_aios_packet_runner.py tests/test_run_validation.py -q`
  passed 30/30; `cd hivemind && python -m pytest -q` passed 404/404;
  `cd hivemind && git diff --check` passed before commit; `python scripts/aios_local_app.py status --json`
  reported `monitor_health: clear` after the child commit.
- next: continue with the next non-clear readiness gap: GenesisOS generative
  divergence remains proposed in ASC-0191, while ASC-0193 still wants a live
  escalation smoke before close.
- status: ASC-0190 closed; monitor dirty blocker cleared

## 2026-05-17T23:08+09:00 — ASC-0193 closed: chat tier-2 quality gate live-smoked

- when: 2026-05-17T23:08+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: live verification, dogfood, quality closeout
- goal: prove the chat router can catch a weak cheap-routed answer and
  escalate once to a stronger local chair, while preserving a visible
  `quality_gate` envelope.
- changed:
  - `docs/contracts/ASC-0193-chat-tier2-quality-gate.md` moved from
    `accepted` to `closed`.
  - `scripts/aios_chat_router.py` gained stronger provider-output
    sanitization after dogfood exposed ANSI cursor-control and thinking-block
    leakage from local model output.
  - `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py` gained sanitizer regression tests.
- decision: the named exit is satisfied by a live cheap-route smoke, not only
  by mocks. `AIOS_LOCAL_AGENT_COMMAND="printf 'Done.'"` intentionally produced
  an inadequate cheap response; the tier-2 gate escalated once to
  `qwen3:30b-a3b` and returned `quality_gate.verdict=escalated_pass`.
- evidence: conversation `asc-0193-live-smoke-clean-v2` produced
  `.aios/chat/asc-0193-live-smoke-clean-v2/messages.jsonl` and
  `.aios/chat/asc-0193-live-smoke-clean-v2/quality_gate.jsonl`; invocation
  receipt `.aios/invocations/chat-11e6bc95360fd969/receipt.json`; tier-2
  focused tests passed 7/7.
- next: the next weak axis is still GenesisOS generative divergence
  (ASC-0191 proposed) and the persona audit's retriever/router/philosophy
  score gaps.
- status: ASC-0193 closed; quality gate is live-smoked and visible in the chat
  envelope

## 2026-05-17T23:18+09:00 — ASC-0191 closed: GenesisOS local generative divergence

- when: 2026-05-17T23:18+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> GenesisOS
- agent: codex@myworld acting operator; codex@GenesisOS implementation
- role: GenesisOS local-helper implementation and contract closeout
- goal: turn GenesisOS from a deterministic divergence scaffold into an
  advisory local-generative divergence layer without granting execution,
  memory, tool-routing, or truth-selection authority.
- changed:
  - GenesisOS commit `5a935b1 Add local generative divergence helper`.
  - `docs/contracts/ASC-0191-genesisos-generative-divergence.md` moved from
    `proposed` to `closed` with explicit local-only GO resolution.
- decision: accept only the local-helper version of the vision-adjacent change.
  Remote generation remains out of scope. Deterministic GenesisOS behavior is
  still the default; generation is opt-in via `--generated` or helper env.
- evidence: `GENESISOS_OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:8b python -m genesisos.cli diverge --goal "AIOS agents keep converging on contracts and dashboards instead of inventing a new interaction ritual" --generated --json`
  produced five generated branch augmentations; `cd GenesisOS && python -m
  pytest tests -q` passed 55/55; `cd GenesisOS && git diff --check` passed
  before commit.
- next: refresh the persona audit and Control Center snapshot so the
  philosophy/generative axis sees ASC-0191 as closed evidence; remaining weak
  axes are MemoryOS retrieval signal coverage and CapabilityOS route evidence
  coverage in new contracts.
- status: ASC-0191 closed; GenesisOS has optional local generative divergence

## 2026-05-18T00:20+09:00 — ASC-0194 accepted + dispatched: memoryOS Graph Control Model

- when: 2026-05-18T00:20+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld → memoryOS
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator
- goal: founder GO — build the Graph Control Model now, dispatch to memoryOS; a Graph Foundation Model is downstream
- changed:
  - docs/contracts/ASC-0194-memoryos-graph-control-model.md — accepted; founder resolution recorded
  - docs/research/LGM_AND_MEMORY_GRAPH_CONTROL.md (new — external study)
  - .claude memory: project_lgm_memory_thesis
  - dispatched ASC-0194 to .aios/inbox/memoryOS/
- decision: the founder reframe (mitigation insufficient; need a control model for the unbounded graph) + the LGM thesis was studied externally. The study's load-bearing correction — "LGM" → Graph Foundation Model; a GFM *consumes* a governed graph, it does not fix an ungoverned one — was accepted by the founder: build the control model now, GFM downstream. ASC-0194 reframed from "graph-network memory / STDP mitigation" into the Graph Control Model: a 7-step dream-cycle organ (score → merge → invalidate → consolidate → community-layer → decay → bound-check) with the bound ratio metric and SSGM failure modes as named stop conditions. Dispatched to codex@memoryOS for implementation.
- evidence: `aios_dispatch.py send` → packet .aios/inbox/memoryOS/asc-0194.memoryOS.json; ASC-0184 hook preflight allowed it, ASC-0185 enqueued a leased job (queued:1).
- next: codex@memoryOS implements when a watcher runs; operator collects + verifies the result. The control model's round-controller wiring (dream-cycle stage) is the myworld-side follow-on.
- status: Graph Control Model contracted, accepted, dispatched to memoryOS

## 2026-05-18T00:23+09:00 — ASC-0194 memoryOS result collected: Graph Control Model alpha

- when: 2026-05-18T00:23+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> memoryOS
- agent: codex@myworld supervising; codex@memoryOS via child watcher
- role: dispatch execution, result collection, focused verification
- goal: clear the `asc-0194` pending dispatch and verify whether memoryOS
  produced the Graph Control Model slice requested by the accepted contract.
- changed:
  - memoryOS commit `e5ecff6 Add graph control model alpha`
  - `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0194.memoryOS.result.json`
  - `.aios/jobs/done/job_20260517_150207_ffc9bd68.json`
- decision: treat ASC-0194 memoryOS implementation as focused-verified, not
  full-gate closed. The child worker implemented the MemoryOS-owned
  read-only/append-only graph-control alpha and committed it; full repo gate is
  not claimed because four existing embed fallback tests fail when Ollama is
  reachable and those tests expect the Ollama-absent path.
- evidence: watcher result status `passed`; memoryOS focused gate
  `python -m pytest tests/test_graph_control.py tests/test_schema.py
  tests/test_doctor.py tests/test_mcp.py -q` passed 513/513; `python -m
  py_compile memoryos/cli.py memoryos/schema.py memoryos/store.py` passed;
  child log records full `python -m pytest -q` reached 2023 passing tests with
  4 environment-limited existing embed fallback failures.
- next: dispatch a separate memoryOS embed-fallback environment-hardening
  contract before claiming ASC-0194 full-gate close; then wire
  `memory graph-control run --persist` into the myworld dream-cycle loop.
- status: ASC-0194 memoryOS slice focused-verified; monitor pending-result
  blocker cleared; full close deferred

## 2026-05-18T00:39+09:00 — ASC-0195 closed: memoryOS embed fallback tests hermetic

- when: 2026-05-18T00:39+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> memoryOS
- agent: codex@myworld supervising; codex@memoryOS via child watcher
- role: contract dispatch, result verification, closeout
- goal: remove the ASC-0194 full-gate blocker where existing embed fallback
  tests depended on whether local Ollama happened to be running.
- changed:
  - memoryOS commit `146b946 Harden embed fallback tests`
  - `docs/contracts/ASC-0195-memoryos-embed-fallback-hermetic-tests.md`
    moved from `accepted` to `closed`
  - `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0195.memoryOS.result.json`
- decision: close ASC-0195 as a deterministic test-fixture fix. The absence of
  Ollama is now created by unreachable local URLs or mocked embedding returns,
  not inferred from ambient host state. No production embedding semantics or
  raw memory ledgers were touched.
- evidence: worker full gate `cd memoryOS && python -m pytest -q` passed
  2027/2027 with 18 subtests; supervisor recheck
  `python -m pytest tests/test_graph_control.py tests/test_embed.py
  tests/test_schema.py tests/test_doctor.py tests/test_mcp.py -q` passed
  578/578 with 5 subtests; `python -m py_compile memoryos/cli.py
  memoryos/embed.py memoryos/schema.py memoryos/store.py` passed; `git diff
  --check` passed.
- next: return to ASC-0194's remaining close condition: wire
  `memory graph-control run --persist` into the myworld dream-cycle loop, then
  refresh monitor/persona evidence so MemoryOS retrieval and GenesisOS advisory
  gaps are visible as first-class next work.
- status: ASC-0195 closed; ASC-0194 embed-test blocker removed

## 2026-05-18T00:48+09:00 — ASC-0194 myworld wiring: bounded graph-control dream stage

- when: 2026-05-18T00:48+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> memoryOS
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: dream-cycle wiring, timeout guard, supervisor verification
- goal: connect MemoryOS `memory graph-control run --persist` into the AIOS
  dream organ without letting a large graph-control scan stall the persistent
  round controller.
- changed:
  - `scripts/aios_dream.py` adds a bounded `memory_graph_control` dream-stage
    hook that calls MemoryOS-owned `memory graph-control run --persist
    --project AIOS --limit 10 --json`.
  - `scripts/aios_round_controller.py` passes explicit dream budgets:
    `--consolidate-budget 120 --graph-control-timeout 60 --helper-timeout
    150`.
  - `tests/test_aios_dream.py` covers successful persisted run summaries,
    graph-control timeout degradation, helper timeout degradation, and
    MemoryOS stats timeout degradation.
- decision: do not close ASC-0194 yet. The hook is present and bounded, but a
  live large-ledger run with a deliberately tiny 2s graph-control budget
  degraded as expected. That is good loop hygiene, not proof that the graph
  control model is repeatably fast enough for closeout.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_dream -v` passed 4/4;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_dream
  tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_refresh_writes_snapshot_and_reports_monitor -v`
  passed 5/5; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_dream.py
  scripts/aios_round_controller.py` passed; short live smoke wrote a dream
  failure report with `memory_graph_control.status=degraded`,
  `reason=graph_control_timeout`, and no lingering child process. After
  restarting the persistent round controller, `.aios/state/round_controller.jsonl`
  entry `2026-05-18T00:54:22+09:00` ran the new `dream` step and recorded
  `memory_graph_control.status=degraded`, `reason=graph_control_timeout`,
  `timeout_seconds=60`; later rounds skipped dream as `recent_dream`.
- next: dispatch MemoryOS performance/incremental-cursor work for
  `graph-control run --persist` so the dream stage can finish on the real
  memory ledger within budget; after that, ASC-0194 can move from bounded alpha
  to closed.
- status: ASC-0194 myworld wiring complete; ASC-0194 remains accepted pending
  large-ledger repeatability

## 2026-05-18T01:14+09:00 — ASC-0196 closed: MemoryOS graph-control budgeted partial runs

- when: 2026-05-18T01:14+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> memoryOS
- agent: codex@myworld supervising; codex@memoryOS via child watcher
- role: dispatch execution, large-ledger smoke verification, closeout
- goal: make MemoryOS graph-control return a parseable named result inside the
  AIOS dream-loop budget instead of hanging or producing empty output.
- changed:
  - memoryOS commit `17fed4d Bound graph control runs`
  - `docs/contracts/ASC-0196-memoryos-graph-control-incremental-budget.md`
    moved from `accepted` to `closed`
  - `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0196.memoryOS.result.json`
- decision: close ASC-0196 as a budgeted repeatability slice. The graph-control
  path now has work-item budgeting plus command-local timeout fallback and
  persists `budget_exhausted` GraphControlRun rows with ASC-0194/ASC-0196
  provenance. This does not close the broader ASC-0194 model-quality condition.
- evidence: worker and supervisor both passed
  `python -m pytest tests/test_graph_control.py tests/test_embed.py
  tests/test_schema.py -q` (81/81, 5 subtests), `python -m py_compile
  memoryos/cli.py memoryos/store.py memoryos/schema.py`, and `git diff
  --check`. Supervisor large-ledger smoke
  `timeout 75s python -m memoryos --root . memory graph-control run --persist
  --project AIOS --limit 10 --json` exited 0 with parseable JSON,
  `status=budget_exhausted`, `report_id=graphctlrun_1f3d12e2d888f365`,
  `stop_conditions=["budget_exhausted"]`.
- next: refresh MyWorld dream-controller evidence so `memory_graph_control`
  moves from caller-side timeout degradation to MemoryOS-side
  `budget_exhausted`; then decide whether ASC-0194 can close or needs another
  quality-focused pass on meaningful queryable-surface metrics.
- status: ASC-0196 closed; graph-control caller no longer hangs on large
  ledger smoke

## 2026-05-18T01:17+09:00 — ASC-0194 hook rechecked after ASC-0196

- when: 2026-05-18T01:17+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld -> memoryOS
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: post-close integration smoke
- goal: prove MyWorld's dream hook now receives a MemoryOS-owned named stop
  instead of caller-side graph-control timeout degradation.
- evidence: direct MyWorld hook call
  `run_memory_graph_control(root, timeout_seconds=70)` returned
  `status=ok`, `persisted=true`, `report_id=graphctlrun_120c7fbf808dd749`,
  `bound_ratio=1.0`, and `stop_conditions=["budget_exhausted"]`.
- decision: keep ASC-0194 open for graph-quality semantics. The operating
  layer is now repeatable and bounded; the next question is whether the
  queryable-surface metrics are meaningful enough to close the full Graph
  Control Model contract.
- next: make Control Center show the latest graph-control run status and stop
  condition, then decide whether ASC-0194 needs a final quality-focused
  MemoryOS pass or can close as a bounded alpha.
- status: MyWorld hook upgraded from timeout-degraded to named-stop evidence

## 2026-05-18T01:22+09:00 — ASC-0197 closed: dispatch requires MemoryOS retrieval evidence when declared

- when: 2026-05-18T01:22+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: dispatch gate implementation, MemoryOS retriever evidence binding
- goal: stop AIOS from claiming MemoryOS usage while dispatching work without a
  concrete `rtrace_...` and positive `signal_coverage`.
- changed:
  - `scripts/aios_dispatch.py` adds `session_envelope_required` and
    `memory_retrieval_required` frontmatter gates.
  - `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py` covers missing-envelope blocking and
    retrieval trace evidence attachment.
  - `docs/contracts/ASC-0197-dispatch-memory-retrieval-gate.md` records the
    closed contract with real MemoryOS trace evidence.
- MemoryOS evidence: invocation
  `.aios/invocations/inv-454672af7ad3-20260518T012019/` produced
  context pack trace `rtrace_b70da6ffc87b1f90` with `signal_coverage: 1.0` and
  ten selected accepted memory ids.
- CapabilityOS evidence: the invocation route selected
  `cap_memoryos_context_build` as top recommendation and remained
  `recommendation_only`.
- GenesisOS evidence: the invocation produced the advisory branch set at
  `.aios/invocations/inv-454672af7ad3-20260518T012019/genesis/branches.json`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_dispatch.py` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch -v` passed 26/26; `python -m
  py_compile scripts/aios_persona_audit.py` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_persona_audit -v` passed 4/4; `git diff --check --
  scripts/aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_dispatch.py` passed. Persona audit
  recheck now scores ASC-0197 with `retriever_score=1.0`, raising the window
  retriever score from 0.0 to 0.05.
- next: make the Control Center show whether a dispatch packet is backed by a
  session envelope and MemoryOS trace, so the end user can see retrieval
  evidence before worker execution.
- status: ASC-0197 closed; future memory-required dispatches fail closed
  without rtrace evidence

## 2026-05-18T05:30+09:00 — ASC-0194 verification: graph-control runs but governs nothing → ASC-0202

- when: 2026-05-18T05:30+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld → memoryOS
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (verify)
- goal: verify ASC-0194 (Graph Control Model) before closeout
- decision: codex@memoryOS implemented ASC-0194 — the 7-step Graph Control Model is in memoryos/cli.py (build_graph_control_model), wired into the dream organ (aios_dream.py run_memory_graph_control as `memoryos memory graph-control run`), 4 unit tests pass on seeded fixtures. BUT operator verification against the named exit found it non-functional on the live store: every run reports `status: budget_exhausted`, `total_memories: 0`, all 7 steps `skipped` — `queryable_surface_count: 0`, `reclaimed_count: 0`. It governs nothing. ASC-0196 ("incremental budget") was closed but the symptom persists empirically — a false-closure signal. ASC-0194 is NOT closed: its named exit (queryable surface O(communities), bound ratio on a non-empty surface) is unmet. Drafted + dispatched ASC-0202 to codex@memoryOS to diagnose the score-step budget exhaustion and make graph-control do real bounded work on the 198K-node store.
- evidence: `memoryos memory graph-control run --json` on the live store (198,790 nodes) → budget_exhausted, total_memories 0; child reported `status: passed` (agent exit 0) — the gap between "agent ran" and "named exit met" is exactly why operator verification exists ([[feedback_observation_vs_verification]]).
- next: codex@memoryOS picks up ASC-0202; ASC-0194 closeout waits on real graph-control work; ASC-0196's empirical non-resolution noted.
- status: ASC-0194 held open — graph-control implemented but governs nothing; ASC-0202 dispatched to fix

## 2026-05-18T06:40+09:00 — ASC-0202 closed: graph-control does real bounded work → ASC-0194 closed

- when: 2026-05-18T06:40+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld → memoryOS
- agent: claude@myworld (deadlock recovery — no codex@memoryOS process running; fix executed by operator-claude on behalf of codex@memoryOS, commit attributed to codex@memoryOS)
- role: operator (intervene → verify → decide)
- goal: make graph-control govern the live store within the dream budget (ASC-0202), then close the spine contract ASC-0194
- decision: diagnosed the score-step budget exhaustion — it was never graph work. `load_embeddings()` json-parses the entire embeddings file (197,682 vectors / 34.7s), exhausting the 45s budget before the 44 accepted MemoryObjects are counted; only 195 rows are `target_type=memory_object`, the rest node embeddings the score step never consumes. `total_memories: 0` was a masked SIGALRM-mid-scan symptom. Fix: `GraphStore.load_embeddings_for_targets()` — streams the file, cheap `target_type` pre-filter, parses only memory-object rows (197,682-row scan 34.7s → 3.6s); routed the four score-step builders + `load_memory_coverage_records` through it. graph-control now completes in 17s with real governance, so ASC-0202 and ASC-0194 are both closed.
- changed: memoryOS `memoryos/store.py`, `memoryos/cli.py`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md` (commit `91b6be7`); myworld `docs/contracts/ASC-0194-*.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0202-*.md` (status closed).
- evidence: `python -m pytest -q` (memoryOS) → 2028 passed, 18 subtests (164s). Live `memory graph-control run --persist` on 198K-node store: run 1 = 17.0s `status=stop_condition` `score.total_memories=44` `resolve_merge.candidate_count=316` `community_layer.queryable_surface_count=14` `bound_ratio=7.86` `stop_conditions=[duplicate_proliferation]`; run 2 = 19.0s `previous_total_memories 0→44` `raw_ingest_count 44→0` (incremental cursor advanced). myworld dream hook `run_memory_graph_control` → `status=ok`, `bound_ratio=1.29`, `queryable_surface_count=11`, `stop_conditions=[semantic_drift, duplicate_proliferation]`.
- risk: low — targeted load is a strict subset of the prior full scan; coverage analytics only ever consumed memory-object embeddings; full suite green.
- next: dream-cycle graph control is live and bounded. ASC-0183 (dream phase-2 parametric per-repo LoRA adapters) remains founder-gated. Next operator focus returns to the tier-2 quality-gate live-escalation smoke and the multi-agent roster UI.
- status: ASC-0202 closed; ASC-0194 closed — the Graph Control Model governs the live store within the dream budget; queryable surface O(communities), bound ratio ≥1, named SSGM stop conditions fire instead of masked budget_exhausted.

## 2026-05-18T15:10+09:00 — ASC-0203 closed: chat routes against the CapabilityOS matrix; tier-2 gate live-smoked

- when: 2026-05-18T15:10+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (verify → decide → intervene)
- goal: ASC-0192 follow-on — tier-2 quality-gate live smoke + close routing item 2
- decision: (1) live-smoked the ASC-0193 tier-2 quality gate on three real cases — a trivial answer (deterministic signal catches "too short" → escalates to qwen3:30b-a3b → 3883-char real answer, escalated_pass), a long-but-off-topic answer (LLM judge qwen3:8b correctly flags "provides general information about Python but does not address..." → escalated_pass), and an adequate answer (verdict=pass, no false escalation). The gate works end-to-end. (2) Operator review of ASC-0192 follow-on item 2 found `provider_candidates_from_capability` still substring-matched the capability payload's JSON dump — the same keyword anti-pattern ASC-0192 removed from tier-1, still governing route selection. Drafted + accepted + implemented + closed ASC-0203: the router now ranks substrates from the CapabilityOS `recommendations` matrix (id/domains→substrate, rec rank preserved, cost=free stable-preferred), with the substring scan kept as the no-matrix fallback.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py` (`provider_candidates_from_capability` rewrite + `_capability_rec_substrate`), `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py` (+3 cases), `docs/contracts/ASC-0203-*.md` (new, closed).
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router` → 45 passed (42 prior + 3 new); tier-2 live smoke A/B/C verdicts as above; `git diff --check` clean.
- risk: low — matrix path only engages with ≥1 dict recommendation; legacy string-list fixtures still exercise the unchanged fallback.
- next: ASC-0192 follow-on item 3 (multi-agent roster surface) still needs its own contract before ASC-0192 closes — next operator focus.
- status: ASC-0203 closed; ASC-0193 tier-2 gate confirmed live; ASC-0192 has 2 of 3 follow-ons resolved.

## 2026-05-18T15:40+09:00 — ASC-0192 closed; ASC-0204 multi-agent roster — data projection done

- when: 2026-05-18T15:40+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (decide → intervene)
- goal: close ASC-0192 (two-tier routing) and open + start its last follow-on (the multi-agent surface)
- decision: ASC-0192's Named Exit was "tier-1 done + the three follow-on items tracked as their own contracts". With ASC-0193 (tier-2 gate, closed) and ASC-0203 (route against CapabilityOS, closed) already covering items 1-2, drafted + accepted ASC-0204 for item 3 (multi-agent roster surface) — so ASC-0192 is now closed. Then implemented ASC-0204 work packet 1 (data projection): `aios_control_snapshot.py` emits a `roster` block (six repo-agents, one-line status digest, out-of-band event with blocked/needs_input floated to the top — cmux borrow) and a `contract_board` block (every contract bucketed into the five lifecycle columns proposed→accepted→dispatched→collected→closed — vibe-kanban borrow; dispatched/collected refined from the dispatch aggregate). Both are read projections — no new store (Invariant 3). UI render (packet 2) is dispatched to codex@myworld.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py` (`build_roster`, `build_contract_board`, `_roster_event`, `load_dispatches` by_contract index, `load_contracts` board_rows), `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py` (+4 cases), `docs/contracts/ASC-0192-*.md` (closed), `docs/contracts/ASC-0204-*.md` (new, accepted).
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot` → 13 passed (9 prior + 4 new); live `build_snapshot` shows roster=6 agents and contract_board bucketing 206 contracts (proposed 29 / accepted 1 / dispatched 0 / collected 1 / closed 175); `git diff --check` clean.
- risk: low — projections are pure read views composed from existing loaders; generated snapshot data files left unregenerated to avoid committing unrelated drift.
- next: ASC-0204 packet 2 — render the roster cards + lifecycle kanban + detail tabs in apps/control/ (codex@myworld UI agent).
- status: ASC-0192 closed; ASC-0204 accepted, data projection done + tested, UI render dispatched.

## 2026-05-18T16:05+09:00 — ASC-0204 closed: multi-agent roster surface live; AIOS readiness L6

- when: 2026-05-18T16:05+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld (UI packet in deadlock recovery — no codex@myworld process running)
- role: operator (verify → intervene → decide)
- goal: complete ASC-0204's UI render so AIOS state is visible, and clear the L6 readiness gap
- decision: readiness was L5 with the L6 "repeatable" gap caused by exactly one pending packet — the `asc-0204` UI packet I had dispatched. Rather than leave it stuck (no codex process to pick it up), implemented ASC-0204 work packet 2: a `#roster` section in apps/control/index.html, `renderRoster` + `renderContractBoard` in app.js (existing render pattern), ~70 lines of themed CSS, and the two new markers in `check_app_js`. Regenerated the snapshot; closed ASC-0204; reconcile archived the now-stale packet; readiness recheck → L6 repeatable, ready=True. The founder now has a literal multi-agent surface — six agent cards with out-of-band event badges + a five-column contract-lifecycle board — which is the "see AIOS" surface ASC-0192 set out to build.
- changed: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`, `apps/control/aios-control-snapshot.json`, `apps/control/aios-control-data.js` (regenerated), `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py` (+2 marker lines), `docs/contracts/ASC-0204-*.md` (closed).
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot` → 13 passed; `node --check apps/control/app.js` ok; `--check-app-js` → ok:true; regenerated snapshot carries roster (6 agents) + contract_board; `aios_readiness.py` → level 6 (L6 repeatable), ready=True.
- risk: MEDIUM-process — apps/control/{index.html,app.js,styles.css} carried a large body of pre-existing uncommitted WIP (codex@myworld / round controller); my ASC-0204 render is entangled with it in those three files, so this commit bundles that WIP. It is test-green (node-check + control-snapshot suite pass). chat.html/chat.js were NOT touched by me and are left uncommitted for codex@myworld. Reversible via git history; surfaced to founder.
- next: AIOS readiness is L6/ready. Remaining open: ASC-0180 (founder-gated hosting trust model), ASC-0183 (founder-gated dream LoRA), 13 proposed contracts pending triage.
- status: ASC-0204 closed; ASC-0192 fully resolved; AIOS readiness L6 repeatable / ready=True.

## 2026-05-18T16:35+09:00 — Contract triage; ASC-0098 paper activated; manuscript advanced

- when: 2026-05-18T16:35+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator (decide → intervene)
- goal: triage the proposed-contract backlog and act on the founder's paper decision
- decision: triaged 13 stale proposed contracts. Withdrew 4 with reasons: ASC-0199 (chat status query auto-promoted as a contract — no scope), ASC-0186 (speculative GenesisOS friction seed, empty goal, undeveloped), ASC-0198 (moot — source ASC-0192 closed successfully), ASC-0108 (AIOS-as-Government simulation — superseded by the founder reframe that the 5 OS are the agent's cognitive personas, not a governance system; founder triage decision). Founder decided to activate the AIOS paper (AIOS-only scope) — accepted ASC-0098 and advanced the manuscript: added §4.3 active memory-graph control to `AIOS_AGENT_OPERATING_LAYER_DRAFT.md`, and three evidence-bound claims C-023 (graph control model), C-024 (two-tier routing + quality gate), C-025 (multi-agent visibility surface) plus a C-005 upgrade (readiness L6) to the claim ledger.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0199/0186/0198/0108-*.md` (withdrawn), `docs/contracts/ASC-0098-*.md` (accepted), `docs/papers/AIOS_AGENT_OPERATING_LAYER_DRAFT.md`, `docs/papers/AIOS_MYWORLD_CLAIM_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: withdrawals carry `withdrawn_reason`; the three new claims cite ASC-0194/0202/0192/0193/0203/0204, memoryOS commit 91b6be7, and the control-snapshot tests; readiness `aios_readiness.py` → L6.
- risk: low — triage withdrawals are reversible status flips with recorded reasons; paper edits are evidence-bound and confined to docs/papers/.
- next: ASC-0098 — dispatch the per-OS work packets (MemoryOS context pack, CapabilityOS route, GenesisOS framing critique, Hive synthesis) and continue tightening the manuscript against the claim ledger before the 2026-05-27 deadline.
- status: 4 contracts withdrawn; ASC-0098 accepted and manuscript advanced; 9 proposed contracts remain (sprint-driver cluster + ASC-0092/0086/0183 kept per founder).

## 2026-05-20T18:04+09:00 — ASC-0210 closed: user@offline becomes a governed frontier primitive

- when: 2026-05-20T18:04+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: executor (AIOS control-plane primitive)
- goal: let AIOS think beyond the user's current knowledge, the active
  agent's context, and model training limits by treating the offline user as a
  bounded observation agent instead of an unstructured chat fallback.
- decision: closed ASC-0210. Added `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`, a
  packet creator/validator for `unknown.frontier.question`,
  `user.offline_task`, `field_observation`, and `contradiction`. Packets are
  draft-first, auto-accept is forbidden, field observations must be
  `observed_by=user@offline`, and private data terms are rejected outside
  explicit boundary fields.
- changed: `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0210-offline-user-agent-frontier-loop.md`,
  `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_offline_user_agent.py`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_offline_user_agent -v` → 6
  passed; CLI dry-run produced a valid `user.offline_task` packet with
  `draft_first=true`, `auto_accept=false`, and no validation warnings.
- next: surface these packets in Control Center/chat so AIOS can visibly show
  "what I do not know", "why I need offline evidence", and "what observation I
  am asking user@offline to perform" before routing results into MemoryOS
  draft review.
- status: ASC-0210 closed; offline user agent loop is now a tested
  control-plane primitive.

## 2026-05-20T18:15+09:00 — Offline user packets surfaced in Control Center and chat

- when: 2026-05-20T18:15+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: UI executor/debugger supporting claude@myworld
- goal: make Claude's cognitive-prosthesis frame and Codex's ASC-0210
  offline-user primitive visible to the operator instead of hiding frontier
  asks inside `.aios/inbox/memoryOS`.
- decision: projected valid `aios.offline_user_agent_packet.v1` packets into
  the Control Center snapshot as `offline_user.latest`. The Evidence Desk now
  renders the newest packet as `Offline User Agent`, and standalone chat shows
  the same card below Decision Map with `Open Packet` and `Prepare Reply`.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- evidence: py_compile passed for snapshot/local/offline scripts; node syntax
  checks passed for app/chat JS; focused unittest suite passed 9 tests;
  snapshot refresh passed; visual verification passed for
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-user-control.png` and
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-user-chat.png`.
- debugging note: a contract-id collision appeared during the slice. Claude
  had renumbered the umbrella cognitive-prosthesis contract to `ASC-0211`, so
  Codex kept `ASC-0210` for the offline-user frontier primitive and aligned
  defaults/tests/docs around that split.
- next: after the user returns a bounded offline observation, surface the
  resulting `field_observation` as a MemoryOS draft-review card with the same
  privacy boundary visible.
- status: UI surface live and visually verified; user@offline is now visible
  as a governed AIOS sense-organ route.

## 2026-05-20T18:22+09:00 — field_observation bridged into MemoryOS draft queue

- when: 2026-05-20T18:22+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: UI/CLI executor and debugger supporting claude@myworld
- goal: let returned `user@offline` observations become visible, reviewable
  MemoryOS draft candidates without accepting memory automatically.
- decision: added a `new-field-observation` path to
  `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`. It writes a governed
  `field_observation` packet to `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/` and mirrors the same
  observation into `.aios/chat/offline-user/memory_drafts.json`, which the
  existing Memory Draft Queue renders with `Request Review`.
- changed: `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_offline_user_agent.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and regenerated control snapshot data.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py
  scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js && node --check apps/control/chat.js`; focused unittest
  suite passed 11 tests; `git diff --check` passed for the touched files;
  visual verification passed for
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-field-memory-draft.png` and
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-field-chat.png`.
- next: wire the visible `Request Review` action through the MemoryOS review
  watcher so an `offline-user:*` draft can return `accept`, `reject`, or
  `needs_more_evidence` as an auditable result packet.
- status: closed for this slice; no accepted MemoryOS records, raw private
  data, credentials, `.env` content, or provider auth logs were written.

## 2026-05-20T18:38+09:00 — offline-user review request closes through MemoryOS watcher

- when: 2026-05-20T18:38+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: UI/CLI executor and debugger supporting claude@myworld
- goal: make `user@offline` field observations move from visible UI card to
  MemoryOS review result without bypassing draft-first review.
- decision: linked `offline_user.latest` rows to their
  `.aios/chat/offline-user/memory_drafts.json` draft ids, added direct
  `Request Review` actions to Control Center and standalone chat, and made the
  snapshot fall back to the draft when the source packet has been consumed by
  MemoryOS import. `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` now skips raw
  `aios.offline_user_agent_packet.v1` sense packets so they cannot block
  executable `mdrev-*` MemoryOS review dispatches.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and regenerated control snapshot data.
- evidence: generated `offline-user:994cbdb7eb50`, posted
  `POST /api/memory_draft_review`, produced
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-6811d9802bfff477.memoryOS.json`, ran
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo memoryOS`, and received
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-6811d9802bfff477.memoryOS.result.json` with
  `status=passed`, `agent_executed=aios_child_watcher.memory_draft_review_adapter`,
  `review_decision=needs_more_evidence`, and `memory_mutated=true`. Focused
  tests passed 16/16; `bash -n`, `py_compile`, `node --check`, and
  `git diff --check` passed; visual receipts `vis-24170e84ce06` and
  `vis-8136206a848a` passed.
- next: if this observation matters for durable behavior, add corroborating
  evidence through the visible Memory Draft `Add Evidence` control and request
  re-review.
- status: closed for this slice; no automatic memory acceptance, secrets,
  `.env` content, raw exports, or provider auth logs were written.

## 2026-05-20T18:48+09:00 — offline-user needs_more_evidence loop gains evidence/re-review controls

- when: 2026-05-20T18:48+09:00 KST
- repo: myworld
- agent: codex@myworld
- role: UI/CLI executor and debugger supporting claude@myworld
- goal: shorten the `needs_more_evidence` loop for `user@offline` observations
  so operators can add evidence and request re-review from the same visible
  Offline User Agent surface.
- decision: added evidence metadata to linked offline-user draft rows, rendered
  `Add Evidence` and `Request Re-review` controls in Control Center and chat,
  and made review indexing timestamp-aware so older MemoryOS results do not
  hide newer re-review requests/results.
- debugging note: visual verification caught a chat layout regression where
  the long offline observation title collapsed into vertical one-character
  text. Fixed `.offline-user-body` to a one-column layout and re-verified.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and regenerated
  control snapshot data.
- evidence: posted supplemental evidence
  `.aios/memory_review_evidence/mrevd-65fed010eeb9e855/evidence.json`; queued
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-207d05a6c64b6513.memoryOS.json`; watcher wrote
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-207d05a6c64b6513.memoryOS.result.json` with
  `status=passed`, `agent_executed=aios_child_watcher.memory_draft_review_adapter`,
  `supplemental_evidence_count=1`, and `review_decision=needs_more_evidence`.
  Focused tests passed 17/17; visual receipts `vis-2895e3b762bd` and
  `vis-7c332675c608` passed; final syntax/diff checks passed.
- next: if another independent observation still leaves MemoryOS at
  `needs_more_evidence`, ask Claude/MemoryOS to tune the review threshold for
  UI-observation memories rather than endlessly collecting same-source proof.
- status: closed for this slice; no automatic memory acceptance, secrets,
  `.env` content, raw exports, or provider auth logs were written.

## 2026-06-05T04:43+09:00 — ASC-0224 MemoryOS provenance cleanup closed

- contract: `ASC-0224`
- dispatch: `asc-0224`
- result: MemoryOS child watcher returned `passed`; result packet collected at
  2026-06-05T04:39:59+09:00.
- commits: MemoryOS `0b3e973` pushed to `origin/main`; MyWorld records the
  submodule pointer and dispatch/watch baseline changes.
- evidence: `allowed_existing_dirty` now includes a status/hash baseline so a
  cleanup contract may consume its named pre-existing dirty input without
  masking later same-file changes. Focused dispatch/watcher tests passed 46/46.
- monitor: `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reports health
  `watch` and no `repo_dirty` findings after MemoryOS commit/push.
- next: continue with advisory GenesisOS/persona-axis monitor items; do not
  reopen ASC-0224 unless MemoryOS provenance verification regresses.

## 2026-06-05T05:02+09:00 — Genesis prompt-prison advisory review split

- goal: keep GenesisOS prompt-prison critique active while preventing reviewed
  findings from repeatedly paging the monitor.
- result: `aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py` now emits
  `unreviewed_flagged` and `reviewed_flagged`; monitor raises
  `genesis_prompt_prison_advisory` only for unreviewed findings.
- evidence: ASC-0212, ASC-0213, ASC-0214, and ASC-0215 now include structured
  `GenesisOS Escape Review` sections. Current critic report shows
  `unreviewed_flagged_count=0`; monitor next action now only reports
  `persona_axis_advisory`.
- provider review: Codex and Claude agreed the split is sound if stale or
  boilerplate reviews remain visible; Gemini was attempted and hit capacity.
- next: continue with persona-axis advisory; do not remove reviewed Genesis
  signatures from report metadata.

## 2026-06-05T05:00+09:00 — Persona-axis justified absence handling

- goal: distinguish explicit 5-persona role evidence and justified absence
  from silent persona-axis drift.
- result: persona audit now reports `role_evidence`, `justified_absences`, and
  strict `evidence_scores`; monitor composite improved to 0.58 while preserving
  the strict evidence composite at 0.45.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_persona_audit
  tests.test_aios_monitor tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed 37/37;
  `python scripts/aios_persona_audit.py --window 20 --json --assert-keys
  weak_personas,contract_gaps,persona_composite,evidence_scores,justified_absences,role_evidence`
  passed; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reports health
  `watch`.
- provider review: Codex warned to preserve waiver state separately from strict
  proof; Claude timed out, Gemini hit capacity/backpressure, and local LLM
  launchers were unavailable.
- next: close the remaining retriever weakness by adding real MemoryOS
  retrieval traces for contracts where retrieval is required, not by broadening
  waiver phrases.

## 2026-05-20 13:42 UTC — claude@myworld — ASC-0214 dogfood-route stale-uncited surfacing

- **reference_l3_full_routines_4of4.md** (0.2d stale) — ASC-0211 L3 Transcendence Engine 4 routines 모두 enacted (2026-05-20); 가장 sharp 한 출력 모음; ASC-0211 close 의 4/5 조건
- **reference_letta_mem0_memory_landscape.md** (0.2d stale) — 2026 agent memory architectures peer landscape — Letta runtime vs Mem0 bolt-on vs Zep vs Supermemory; AIOS MemoryOS 위치

  Each above requires explicit operator decision within 7 days: (a) new ASC contract / (b) ledger-reject reason / (c) explicit keep-stale.

## 2026-06-05T20:20+09:00 — substrate/plugin/knowledge boundary checkpoint

- goal: answer the founder boundary question: whether AIOS should touch deep
  process/OS substrate, remain agent-friendly plugins, or require all
  available knowledge.
- decision: keep AIOS plugin/control-plane first. Use process/OS substrate only
  for authority enforcement, isolation, lifecycle control, quotas, kill/retry,
  secret boundaries, and audit/provenance receipts. Treat multi-model,
  web-research, local-LLM, classic, and cross-domain evidence as knowledge
  scope, not execution authority.
- evidence: boundary classifier routed the question to
  `execution_substrate`/Hive with `execute_with_receipt`, but contract
  autodraft was held by `monitor_not_clear`. Web comparison used Kubernetes
  CRI, VS Code extension host, and Chrome Manifest V3 patterns: deep runtime
  or worker boundaries sit behind stable interfaces, while most user-facing
  capabilities remain extension/plugin surfaces.
- provider evidence: Claude CLI was unavailable due weekly limit; Gemini CLI
  was unavailable due quota exhaustion; local Ollama was not installed. The
  side-agent review independently recommended the same split: substrate
  enforces permission, plugins expand capability, knowledge increases
  confidence.
- next: new contracts should continue carrying a Substrate / Plugin /
  Knowledge Gate. Do not let multi-model consensus, provider availability, or
  broad research evidence bypass contract authority, owner boundaries, or
  receipts.

## 2026-06-05T20:28+09:00 — goal evolution advisory-stop and stale-radar tightening

- goal: keep autonomous goal evolution moving on non-blocking advisory monitor
  findings while preventing closed Hive TODO signals from re-entering
  contract autodraft.
- changed: split the oversized goal evolution planner into focused source,
  candidate, plan, and stop-condition modules; `aios_goal_evolution.py` is now
  a thin CLI wrapper. Info-only monitor `watch` findings no longer emit
  `monitor_not_clear`; Hive radar-gap sources are blocked as
  `stale_hive_radar_gap_source` when their concrete Hive TODO refinements are
  already closed.
- evidence: focused tests passed 19/19 across goal evolution, contract
  autodraft, and boundary classifier; py_compile passed for the refactored
  modules; `git diff --check` passed. Live goal evolution now emits
  `stop_conditions=[]` despite the advisory persona-axis monitor item, and
  contract autodraft dry-run produces proposed-only `ASC-0228` for the next
  non-stale Hive candidate.
- next: use the proposed-only contract autodraft result for the next bounded
  Hive/MyWorld contract, but keep stale radar-gap and closed TODO references
  blocked unless a fresh unchecked owner task appears.

## 2026-06-05T20:33+09:00 — goal evolution source hygiene extended

- goal: prevent goal evolution from turning raw provider transcripts or
  graph/index documents into executable Hive contract candidates.
- changed: added a dedicated source-hygiene module for goal evolution candidate
  filtering. Provider transcript/import-style markdown now blocks with
  `provider_transcript_source_requires_triage`; `VISION_GRAPH.md` and other
  index sources block with `index_source_requires_triage` before autodraft.
- evidence: `hivemind/docs/my_world.md` begins as a ChatGPT transcript with
  attachment markers and personal research discussion, so it is no longer
  allowed to produce a direct Hive execution contract. `VISION_GRAPH.md`
  describes itself as a graph-like index and is now treated as triage input,
  not as the task itself.
- next: continue tightening broad radar/document hits into precise owner TODOs,
  dispatch packets, or contract seeds before allowing execution authority.

## 2026-06-06T06:59+09:00 — goal evolution product P0 refinement

- goal: keep autonomous goal evolution pointed at concrete owner work instead
  of stale Hive surfaces, broad worklogs, or legacy TUI docs.
- changed: legacy Hive surface docs now block with
  `legacy_surface_source_requires_triage`; `HIVE_PRODUCT_EVALUATION.md` now
  refines to the first `Next Product P0` numbered item before contract
  autodraft.
- evidence: focused tests passed 23/23 across goal candidate refinement,
  source hygiene, goal evolution, contract autodraft, and boundary classifier.
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check` passed. Live goal evolution now
  recommends
  `myworld/hivemind/docs/HIVE_PRODUCT_EVALUATION.md#next-product-p0-1` with
  task `Policy-gate or replace the unsafe Claude execute workaround before
  adding broader automation`; autodraft dry-run proposes `ASC-0228` without
  writing it.
- monitor: `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reports `watch`
  only for the existing info-level `persona_axis_advisory`.
- next: dispatch or accept the proposed Hive/MyWorld contract only with a
  bounded policy gate for the unsafe Claude execute workaround; do not broaden
  automation until that P0 is closed with receipts.

- role: AIOS operator — capability-factory build + Claude-side product review
- goal: realize the override's outside-value goal — AIOS produces real student value, generalizing across a capability family, and begin productization in uri.

- evidence: 685-test myworld regression green; uri deadline slice typechecks clean + 5 tests pass; unified value ledger spans 4 capabilities; MemoryOS product coverage 0→3/47.
- decision: ship the deterministic copilot core (correct without an LLM) as the value; LLM narrative + receipt persistence are opt-in. Productize in uri import-first, deterministic-only in prod, bundled as one dispatcher-backed "campus copilot".
- risk: I (claude) overstepped uri's Claude↔Codex split by authoring uri implementation/UI — flagged in uri AGENT_WORKLOG; codex@uri must own/validate it and run UI through the image-board workflow. Student data persistence needs the consent gate per COPILOT_DATA_POLICY before real users.
- next: codex@uri builds the import-first UX + consent/retention + unified per-student memory (the moat); founder decides GO on uri productization.

- repo: myworld + uri (cross-repo)
- role: operator / founder-delegated senior engineer
- goal: distill the founder-shared what.md fossil (5306 lines: Lindblad tutorial + stray Solidity royalty contract) into its one product signal and land it: Uri Ledger (per-contributor attribution+settlement for Uri Work) + the outcome bridge that feeds product reality back into AIOS routing profiles (자가 공진 loop closure).
- changed: uri/src/lib/uri-ledger.ts + uri/tests/uri-ledger.test.ts + uri/docs/URI_LEDGER_DESIGN.md (commit 8571ac0, uri); myworld/scripts/aios_outcome_bridge.py + tests/test_aios_outcome_bridge.py.
- evidence: uri 627/627 tests green (615→627); end-to-end smoke: real reputation() output (credits 0.2+0.64+0.16=1.0, KRW 6000+19200+4800=30000 exact conservation) → bridge dry-run maps agent:poster-v2→local/completion promoter signal, reports memory/human as unmapped (not guessed).
- decision: rejected the fossil's packaging (on-chain, ERC20 fractional shares — 증권성 risk per FSC 조각투자 가이드라인, quantum simulation); kept credit conservation + jump/no-jump distinction + append-only discipline. Bridge thresholds = NPS standard cutpoints (promoter ≥9 / detractor ≤6 / passive = no signal), not magic numbers.
- risk: attribution weightHints are orchestrator-self-reported (acceptable single-orchestrator, must become attestation-backed before external contributors); no-jump costSavedKrw needs counterfactual estimates — marked as estimates in evidence. claude authored uri implementation (Claude↔Codex split overstep) under direct founder directive "네가 생각하는 초안 작성해봐" — flagged in uri worklog for codex@uri review.
- next: wire attribution emission into Uri Work job close-out; populate .aios/contributor_substrates.json as real jobs land; codex@uri validates the uri module.

## 2026-06-12 10:47 KST — claude@myworld — GenesisOS divergence-layer review (doctrine↔code audit)

- repo: GenesisOS (reviewed by operator from myworld; no GenesisOS source edited)
- role: review / operator
- goal: review GenesisOS divergence layer for correctness, doctrine compliance, and quality; surface findings for the AIOS dev agent (codex@GenesisOS).
- changed: docs-only (this ledger entry). GenesisOS working tree untouched.
- evidence: `python -m pytest` 58 passed; ~2834 LOC across 12 modules; smoke: `critic --text "hello world"` → confidence 0.333 (2 false-positive signatures); `chamber --goal …` → 5 branches OK; `diverge --generated` → status `generated` (local ollama qwen3:8b via hivemind sibling bin actually invoked).
- decision: no new ASC contract (founder 2026-05-20 freeze). Findings handed to codex@GenesisOS as review notes; no auto-fix applied.
- risk (findings, severity-ordered):
  - MEDIUM — `branches.collapse` → `write_branch_state` overwrites branch JSON **in place** (`genesisos/branches.py:258-265`), contradicting README/doctrine "branch records are append-only" and DNA invariant #3. Audit survives only in `events/`; prior `alive`/`collapsed_to` state is destroyed. Fix: derive branch state from an append-only event log (as `library` already does), or correct the doctrine wording.
  - MEDIUM — README "All GenesisOS surfaces are local, deterministic" vs `--generated`/`generator.py` invoking local LLM (non-deterministic). Authority boundary is respected (`advisory_only`, `no_remote_llm`, prompt via stdin → no goal injection) but the determinism claim is false. Fix: qualify README ("deterministic by default; `--generated` is local non-deterministic advisory opt-in").
  - MEDIUM — `critic` precision: `assumption-silent` and `time-frozen` signatures fire on almost any short/benign text (`"hello world"` → confidence 0.333). Fix: gate both on `len(words) >= 40` like `mono-language`/`single-frame`.
  - MINOR — `chamber.py` re-implements `BRANCH_TYPES` + branch templates from `cli.py:branch()` with already-diverging wording; `now_iso`/`slug`/`short_hash` duplicated across modules → drift risk; extract shared module.
  - MINOR — `branches.write_event` hashes payload without timestamp; re-collapse with same (goal,winner,reason) → event `skipped_existing` while branch files are still rewritten (asymmetric).
  - MINOR — `diverge --generated` runs N sequential LLM subprocess calls (5 branches × ≤60s timeout = up to ~5min worst case).
  - GOOD — `library` soft-bury (immutable seed + `_events/` state-derive), idempotent writes (`skipped_existing`), input validation, and `resolve_text` inline/path fix are solid; authority boundary is 1:1 between doctrine and code.
- next: codex@GenesisOS to address #1 (append-only collapse) and #3 (critic precision) as the highest-value fixes; #2 is a one-line README correction.
- status: done (review delivered; fixes owned by codex@GenesisOS)

## 2026-06-12 10:47 KST — claude@myworld — CapabilityOS code review (no change)

- repo: CapabilityOS
- role: founder-delegated senior engineer / reviewer (observe/verify; contract freeze respected — no new ASC, no code change)
- goal: full review of the `capabilityos` package so AIOS-developing agents in
  myworld can pick up the findings without re-reading the source.
- changed: `CapabilityOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md` (detailed findings entry); this
  ledger pointer. No source/catalog mutation.
- evidence: `python -m pytest` → 23 passed; `DEFAULT_CATALOG` ↔
  `tests/fixtures/capabilities.json` verified byte-identical (19 cards);
  recommendation-only invariant confirmed via `audit` (`execution_enabled: []`)
  and `test_audit_reports_recommendation_only_catalog`.
- decision: no invariant violations. Findings logged for the owning agent, NOT
  minted as contracts. Priority order:
  - P1 (design): `confidence_from_observations` ignores the card's hand-set
    confidence as a Beta prior → a 0.8 card collapses to 0.5 after one pass+fail
    batch. Observations overwrite the prior instead of updating it.
  - P2 (maintainability): dual source of truth (~450-line inline `DEFAULT_CATALOG`
    duplicates the fixture; guarded by a drift test but doubles every edit) +
    CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md doc error ("reads the fixture catalog by default" is
    false — default is the embedded dict).
  - P3/P4: minor dead code (`{contract_id}-placeholder.md` fallback, unused
    `observation_count` baseline branch, ≤2-char term drop) and nits (`--json`
    no-op, zero-observation provider tie-break, `_bool` string coercion).
- risk: P1 fix changes the expected value in
  `test_recommend_can_use_observation_history` — needs operator/founder sign-off
  before patching. Everything else is non-breaking.
- next: owning CapabilityOS agent decides whether P1+P2 warrant a minimal
  fix-packet. Full detail in `CapabilityOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`
  (2026-06-12 entry).
- status: done (review delivered; no change; fixes pending GO)

## 2026-06-12 21:00 KST — claude@myworld — infrastructure vision + hook layer completion

- repo: myworld

- changed:
  - `.claude/settings.json` — plan mode default + 5 hook events wired
  - `scripts/aios_hive_verify_hook.py` — PostToolUse: exit-code/exception detection → context inject (HiveMind)
  - `scripts/aios_stop_hook.sh` — Stop: event processor + self-record + bus emit
  - `scripts/aios_education_hook.py` — UserPromptSubmit: conceptual question → knowledge injection
  - `scripts/aios_guard_hook.py` — PreToolUse expanded: GenesisOS irreversible-cmd challenge inject
- evidence: all 5 hooks pipe-tested; 920 tests green; git db35aab
- decision: hooks now cover SessionStart/PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop/UserPromptSubmit. Pattern absorbed from Gemini lifecycle union, Codex PostToolUse quality gate, Anthropic additionalContext spec.
- infrastructure gap recorded (see below):
  - Phase 1: MemoryOS Akashic Records pipeline + local credentials vault + session checkpoint
  - Phase 2: execution sandbox (Morph/E2B) + observability (OTel) + API gateway
  - Phase 3: SECI 4-direction pipeline + cross-model hivemind ambient + entropy injection
  - Phase 4: subconscious layer (hooks below agent awareness, memory pre-loads, capability pre-routes)
  - Critical blocker: multi-agent concurrent memory writes with conflict resolution (unsolved industrywide)
- inbox status: hivemind 2 pending (ASC-0180 deliberation), memoryOS 12 pending (memory draft reviews)
- risk: memoryOS inbox backlog growing (12 drafts unreviewed) — needs regular processing cadence
- next: establish work intake system before Phase 1 implementation; process memoryOS inbox backlog
- status: done (hooks deployed; roadmap recorded; intake system pending)

## 2026-06-13 00:04 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0237 Akashic lineage closeout

- repo: myworld + memoryOS
- role: control-plane verification / MemoryOS implementation closeout
- goal: close the world-readiness gap for durable work lineage and Akashic observability without storing raw provider history.
- changed: `memoryOS/memoryos/akashic_ledger.py`, `memoryOS/tests/test_akashic_ledger.py`, `memoryOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0237-memoryos-akashic-work-lineage-replay-index.md`, `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`.
- evidence: MemoryOS Akashic index tests cover reconstructability, raw-body rejection, secret-like rejection, and append idempotency; world readiness reports 6 met axes and 1 partial axis after the MemoryOS marker.
- decision: ASC-0237 is closed; cloud execution isolation is not closed by this work and now routes explicitly to ASC-0240 instead of the credential broker contract.
- risk: hosted runtime isolation remains unproven; no final world-deployment claim is allowed until Hive produces filesystem/process/network/package/timeout/quota/credential-reference receipts.
- next: execute ASC-0240 in `hivemind` for hosted runtime isolation receipts, then rerun `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json`.
- status: done

## 2026-06-13 00:50 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0240 Hive runtime isolation receipts

- repo: hivemind + myworld
- role: execution substrate implementation / control-plane verification
- goal: close the hosted runtime isolation readiness gap with explicit filesystem/process/network/package/timeout/credential-reference receipts.
- changed: `hivemind/hivemind/cloud_isolation.py`, `hivemind/tests/test_cloud_isolation.py`, `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `hivemind/.ai-runs/shared/comms_log.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0240-hive-hosted-runtime-isolation-receipts.md`.
- evidence: Hive cloud isolation tests passed 6/6; focused run validation and provider passthrough tests passed 23/23; py_compile and `git diff --check` passed.
- decision: ASC-0240 is closed at marker/schema level. Hive receipts fail closed when sandbox backend evidence is missing, support network-denied receipts, and reject credential-looking values and raw provider body fields.
- risk: this proves the receipt primitive, not a live hosted production deployment. The next proof must wire real provider/local worker execution through the receipt path and project the result into MemoryOS Akashic lineage.
- next: run MyWorld world readiness; if all seven axes are met, create a follow-up contract for live hosted-run proof and deployment packaging rather than claiming production deployment is complete.
- status: done

## 2026-06-12 23:55 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0241 live proof seed

- repo: myworld
- role: control-plane planner
- goal: prevent marker-level world readiness from being mistaken for live hosted deployment proof.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0241-live-hosted-run-proof-and-akashic-projection.md`
- evidence: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` reports `ready=true`, `met=7`, `partial=0`, `missing=0`, but ASC-0240 explicitly proves the receipt primitive rather than a live hosted run.
- decision: proposed ASC-0241 as the next contract: wire a real Hive provider/local worker path to write runtime isolation receipts and project the result into MemoryOS Akashic lineage.
- risk: without this follow-up, AIOS could overclaim readiness from marker files alone.
- next: accept/dispatch ASC-0241 to `hivemind` with MemoryOS projection support.
- status: proposed

- evidence: `python3 scripts/aios_live_hosted_proof.py --write-memory --json` produced run `run_20260612_235914_2fd12a`, runtime receipt `hivemind/.runs/run_20260612_235914_2fd12a/runtime_isolation/provider_codex_native_01.json`, and Akashic index `akashic_c12ae7508fd4cb1b`; focused Hive tests passed 19/19; MyWorld ASC-0241 proof test passed.
- decision: ASC-0241 is closed for deterministic provider prepare proof. This proves the receipt/projection path, not full hosted production deployment.
- risk: actual hosted worker backend, fresh-checkout install, and credential broker adoption remain unproven.

## 2026-06-13 00:09 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0242 packaging smoke and credential broker adoption

- repo: myworld
- role: deployment proof / privacy boundary implementation
- goal: prove installer behavior from a fresh source copy without touching operator home/profile, and route missing provider credentials through the credential broker.
- changed: `scripts/aios_install.sh`, `scripts/aios_packaging_proof.py`, `scripts/aios_provider.py`, `tests/test_aios_packaging_proof.py`, `tests/test_aios_provider_credentials.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0242-packaging-smoke-and-credential-broker-adoption.md`.
- evidence: packaging proof test and provider credential broker test passed 2/2; `scripts/aios_packaging_proof.py --json` returned `ok=true`, `install_returncode=0`, `provider_status_returncode=0`, `copied_git_dir=false`, `copied_aios_runtime_state=false`, `wrote_operator_shell_rc=false`; py_compile passed for Python proof/provider files; `bash -n scripts/aios_install.sh` passed.
- decision: ASC-0242 is closed for privacy-safe fresh-copy install smoke and missing Claude credential broker adoption.
- risk: this is not a published package or real hosted worker backend. The source tree is still dirty and ahead of origin; release/archive smoke from a clean committed tree remains unproven.
- next: hosted backend selection + clean-tree release/archive install smoke + provider credential broker adoption for all hosted providers.
- status: done

## 2026-06-13 00:12 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0243 hosted backend selection seed

- repo: myworld
- role: deployment planner / external-source route
- goal: prevent local working-tree smoke from being mistaken for a release/archive or hosted backend proof.
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0243-hosted-backend-selection-and-release-archive-smoke.md`
- evidence: official OpenAI Codex docs describe managed cloud containers and CLI/app sandbox controls; Anthropic release notes describe Claude Managed Agents, multi-agent orchestration, and self-hosted sandboxes on AWS; Gemini API docs describe Interactions server-side history/background agentic workflows and Deep Research agent workflows.
- decision: proposed ASC-0243 with backend tiers: local-first release archive, Codex Cloud optional, Anthropic Managed Agents optional, Gemini Interactions research optional.
- risk: provider-hosted routes require operator account, IAM/environment, and credential prerequisites; CapabilityOS should recommend but not execute the binding.
- next: run clean release/archive install smoke and produce backend selection receipt.
- status: proposed

## 2026-06-13 00:14 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0243 selected-source release archive smoke

- repo: myworld
- role: deployment proof / backend selection
- goal: prove install from a selected-source archive and record the first hosted-backend tier decision without relying on dirty workspace state.
- changed: `scripts/aios_release_archive_proof.py`, `tests/test_aios_release_archive_proof.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0243-hosted-backend-selection-and-release-archive-smoke.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_release_archive_proof -v` passed; `python3 scripts/aios_release_archive_proof.py --json` returned `ok=true`, `install_returncode=0`, `provider_status_returncode=0`, `archive_forbidden_runtime_or_private_paths_present=[]`, and `wrote_operator_shell_rc=false`.
- decision: selected first deployment tier is `local_first_release_archive`; hosted tiers remain optional and checkpoint-gated: Codex Cloud, Anthropic Managed Agents, Gemini Interactions research.
- risk: selected-source archive proof is not a clean commit/tag/package release. The current tree remains dirty and ahead of origin.
- next: scope, commit, and push the AIOS readiness work in clean batches, then rerun release archive smoke from the committed tree.

- evidence: 45/45 tests pass; monitor findings 164→4; commit 85d70ad; dispatch_contract_path_missing false positives eliminated (160 cases)
- decision: added exact-filename history fallback under docs/_history/contracts/ — resolves only when path starts with docs/contracts/ and identical basename exists in archive; no broad fallback; active path still wins if both exist

- decision: fixed 3 P0 kernel authority holes: (1) fs.list bypassed authorize_step, (2) path traversal via ../ not caught before scope check, (3) user.checkpoint fell to unknown syscall on approved resume. Also fixed symlink escape via Path.resolve() and hardcoded memory path portability in 2 scripts. ASC-0246 was rendered complete by 4e7291d before its packet arrived.

- changed: docs/contracts/ASC-0249-build-runtime-isolation-boundary.md, docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md
- evidence: process inventory showed live round controller, pulse loops, provider sessions, and MCP servers sharing the same myworld root; ASC-0248 Claude session was closed by result packet but still running until manually terminated
- decision: proposed a Claude-owned build/runtime profile boundary instead of Codex directly implementing code; immediate stale ASC-0248 provider process was isolated by terminating only its process group after verification

- evidence: ASC-0249 partial dirty changes pass 75/75 focused tests plus py_compile/bash-n/diff-check, but lack dedicated tests and closeout; current `apps/control` and `aios_workbench.py` are local/operator surfaces, not a real user-facing service UI; external docs show OpenAI Agents SDK sandbox/session/memory, Claude Managed Agents, and Gemini Interactions/Deep Research have moved toward hosted/sessionful agent harnesses.
- decision: do not overclaim UI readiness. Create ASC-0250 to finish isolation tests/closeout first, and ASC-0251 as a proposed separate end-user serving interface spine.
- risk: until ASC-0250 closes, build-control and live-agent runtime remain only partially separated; until ASC-0251 is implemented, AIOS has no well-made user serving interface.
- next: dispatch ASC-0250 to Claude with the existing partial dirty files as allowed baseline; keep ASC-0251 proposed.

- evidence: 101/101 focused tests pass (+26 new over 75 baseline); py_compile + bash -n + git diff --check clean; dispatch status and round_controller status both report runtime_profile=build_control live_child_execution_blocked=True; monitor stale_provider_session_for_closed_dispatch alert fires on a lease surviving a result packet and clears when the lease is removed
- decision: preserved profile schema aios.runtime_profile.v1 (build_control default, no defect found); fixed dispatch status to always print the profile line; did NOT build the end-user serving UI (left as ASC-0251 next-step). No child repos or private stores touched.
- risk: low and reversible — test-only additions plus one status-print fix under .aios-gated profile state; live monitor blocked health is only asc-0250 dispatch_results_pending, not a real lease leak (.aios/leases empty)
- next: Codex verifies + collects .aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0250.myworld.result.json, then closes ASC-0249 and ASC-0250; serving interface remains ASC-0251 (proposed)

- evidence: Codex reran the full ASC-0250 verification gate: 101/101 focused tests passed; py_compile passed; `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed; `git diff --check` passed; `aios_dispatch.py status` and `aios_round_controller.py status` show `runtime_profile=build_control live_child_execution_blocked=True`; monitor health returned to `watch` after result collection with `.aios/leases` empty.
- decision: ASC-0249 and ASC-0250 are closed. The local build/runtime profile boundary is now evidence-backed. This does not claim a true end-user serving UI; ASC-0251 remains proposed for that product surface.
- risk: runtime profile separation is local and visible, not a complete hosted multi-tenant service boundary.

- changed: docs/contracts/ASC-0251-end-user-serving-interface-spine.md, docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md, docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md
- evidence: ASC-0250 is closed; dispatch status shows `runtime_profile=build_control live_child_execution_blocked=True`; Product Design user-context preflight reports no saved visual/product context, so UI implementation must wait for a visual target or prototype contract.
- decision: ASC-0251 is accepted for a Claude-authored design/spec packet only. Current `apps/control` must not be repurposed as the user-facing service UI.
- risk: until the spec/prototype contracts close, AIOS still has no well-made end-user serving interface.

- decision: spec-first approach; no UI code produced; end_user_serving runtime profile and apps/serving/ deferred to implementation contracts

- decision: ASC-0251 is closed as a design/spec artifact. It intentionally does not implement UI; the next aligned step is a separate prototype contract for `apps/serving/` after a visual direction is selected.
- risk: AIOS still lacks a runnable end-user serving interface until that prototype/build contract closes.

- decision: treat current world readiness as infrastructure-complete but service-readiness-overclaimed. Delegate the correction to Claude under ASC-0252 instead of directly absorbing the code change in Codex.
- risk: until ASC-0252 closes, `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py` may mislead operators into thinking AIOS is ready for end-user service deployment.

- decision: partial (spec docs exist) ≠ met (implementation exists); 7 infra axes alone cannot claim world-ready for a user-service product

- decision: service-readiness overclaim is corrected. AIOS is not world-ready as a user-facing service until the serving surface/runtime/browser proof exists.
- risk: `aios_child_watcher.sh` cannot execute `--repo myworld`, so myworld-targeted Claude dispatches still need a manual/provider-specific bridge or watcher support.

- decision: fix the watcher bridge before accepting ASC-0253 implementation work, so future Claude development can run through AIOS receipts instead of manual side channels.

- decision: `myworld` is now a first-class watcher target. Provider dispatch packets addressed to `myworld` can execute from the workspace root and return normal myworld result packets.
- risk: explicit `start --repo all` now includes `myworld`; this is intentional but should remain governed by dispatch policy and runtime profile controls.

- decision: `end_user_serving` is now a recognized conservative runtime profile. It does not open live child execution unless an explicit allow flag or valid `.aios/serving/**` session artifact is bound. Serving session creation is deterministic, user/session-scoped, approval-first, and draft-memory-only.

- decision: `send --force` may overwrite same-agent packets, but it cannot convert an existing packet from one provider to another. Mismatches record `agent_binding_mismatch` or `agent_reassign_blocked`; result evidence is included when present.
- risk: no explicit cancel/archive/reissue command exists yet, so wrong-agent stale packets require a new dispatch id or future operator primitive.

- risk: if not implemented, future Claude-owned serving work can still get stuck behind a stale wrong-agent packet, even though it cannot be silently overwritten.

- evidence: Claude child-watcher attempt for `asc-0257` held with `pending_concurrent_work`; `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch -v` passed 55/55; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/aios_dispatch.py` passed; `git diff --check` passed.
- decision: wrong-agent recovery now uses `reissue` to create a new dispatch id and cite/archive old evidence. Pending source packets are archived; result-bearing source dispatches are preserved and cited.
- risk: no UI/API affordance yet; this is a CLI/control-plane primitive only.
- next: future serving work can safely dispatch to Claude/Gemini/local and use `reissue` if stale packets or provider routing mistakes occur.

- decision: a confirmed brief with `needs_ideation` permits Product Design ideation only. Implementation requires a concrete visual target.

AIOS must prove durable session state, resumable sandbox workspaces, typed execution/background work, access-grant credentials, governed memory, cited research ingestion, observability, and Genesis anti-convergence before real serving launch.
- risk: baseline is source-backed research, not implementation; MemoryOS/CapabilityOS/GenesisOS still need owner-bound follow-up to turn it into reviewed memory, routes, and launch challenge.

- evidence: read dream map, ASC-0270 contract, shared language, definition, north star, substrate boundary, negative evidence spec, agent service baseline; semantic handshake clean (0 ambiguous terms); no apps/serving touched; no memory auto-accepted; no execution dispatched.
- decision: proposed ASC-0271 with 8 growth invariants, 5 owner-bound follow-on contracts, 9 safe-now vs 6 blocked-until-proof sequencing gates, dream preservation rules, and 11 consolidated stop conditions. Contract status is proposed — operator decides acceptance. Codex verifier preserved Claude's second hardening draft as `ASC-0271-AUX` and corrected its premature accepted/human-approved metadata to `superseded_duplicate_draft`.
- risk: invariant pack is comprehensive but may over-constrain early exploration if applied rigidly; operator should treat invariants as guardrails not walls during Phase 1 internal hardening.

- evidence: official/current external sources checked for OpenAI Agents SDK, sandbox agents, tracing, sessions/state, Agent Builder, MCP, Anthropic MCP connector, Google A2A, and Google Interactions API; GenesisOS critic forced assumptions/negations, 1h/1w/1y horizons, plain language, and a cross-domain frame, then returned no prison signatures; child repo worktrees were clean before contract drafting; no `apps/**` or child implementation files were changed.
- decision: ASC-0272..ASC-0276 are proposed Gate A contracts with `human_approved=false`; they convert the broad AIOS infrastructure objective into MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, Hivemind, and MyWorld owner-bound work packets while preserving MemoryOS draft-first, CapabilityOS recommendation-only, GenesisOS speculative-only, and Hivemind receipt-bound authority.
- risk: these contracts are dispatch-ready planning artifacts, not implemented infrastructure; production serving still depends on visual target selection, UI/browser proof, and later Gate B/C work.

- decision: entropy quota is speculative-only gate returning pass/partial/block. Major risk requires discomfort or counter-branch (block if missing). Multi-provider surfaces require convergence challenge. Major risk requires dated external baseline. Findings are gate signals, not truth claims.
- risk: GenesisOS tests use pytest runner (not unittest discover with tests.* prefix). Verified correct runner.

Blocked source types (raw_provider_log, raw_user_export, private_provider_output, raw_chat_export) raise ValueError at ingest. Privacy class "private" blocked. stable_id() produces "src_<hex>" opaque refs (underscore prefix, never sequential).

- decision: Credential grants use opaque refs only (vault:// or short hash); 8 raw credential patterns (sk-*, ghp_*, xox*, AKIA*, ya29.*, Bearer, Password, JWT) blocked at schema validation. Provider blindspot harvesting classifies friction events (refusal/timeout/hallucination/credential_friction/convergence/sandbox_mismatch/unavailable_fallback); marks single-provider routes with risk flags. All output recommendation_only=true. CapabilityOS never executes tools or binds credentials.
- risk: Schema-level blocking catches known patterns but not all future credential formats. Opaque ref convention (vault://) is advisory, not enforced against external credential managers.

- decision: accepted. Stage-1 = internal completion judge (paired 17/24, tie≠win, exact binomial α=0.032); Stage-2 (≥100 non-team-authored hidden instances) required before any external headline claim. Implementation unblocked: WP-A wiring (recon confirms gate switch off/llm-judge/organs + blocking seam already at HEAD; gaps = aios_head.py thread-through, per-organ disable flags in _gate_organs, provenance-guard organ net-new), WP-B harness, WP-C ablation-replay + SLM-delta witness.
- risk: codex substrate degraded today; SLM-V3 (2603.14588) scoop response landed in paper §3.1 item 0 + prereg v1.2 SLM-delta arm (descentnet 88a16f9) — witness implementation (WP-C) is the remaining scoop-defense artifact.

- evidence: current official sources establish the promotion deadline as 2026-07-12 23:59:59 PT (2026-07-13 15:59:59 KST) and continued Fable access through usage credits/API; a bounded local identity probe returned modelUsage=claude-fable-5 with no fallback; the provider receipt records USD 5.5129078 aggregate cost against a USD 5.00 cap after a Dynamic Workflow call overshot its USD 1.60 guard and produced no final synthesis; the frozen qwen3:1.7b evaluation ran 24 calls over 12 paired tasks, focused tests passed 14/14, 66/66 control-plane dispatch/contract/DNA tests passed, and an independent verifier recomputed hashes, timing, model digest, and aggregates with PASS
- decision: no authentication/payment/entitlement/safeguard bypass was attempted; no Claude output or hidden reasoning became a training target; the full compact capsule returned HONEST_NEGATIVE on qwen3:1.7b (B1/B0 wins 0/0, 12 ties, scope violations 3/1, malformed 2/1) and is not promoted for T1
- risk: the Claude CLI budget flag behaved as a soft/lagging guard and contract spend overshot by USD 0.5129078, so all further ASC-0283 provider calls are stopped; the workspace-root distill/** artifact remains QUARANTINED_UNREVIEWED and was not read, dispatched, trained on, published, deleted, or rewritten; Hivemind full regression is 436/437 with one unrelated shared-/tmp/.aios state failure; ASC-0283 CapabilityOS and MemoryOS packets remain held by action policy; round controller remains intentionally stopped (running=false, stop_file=True, live_child_execution_blocked=True)
- next: preserve frozen V1; under a new preregistered contract test a T1 one-state external wrapper with per-output manifest hashes, then consider an unchanged-capsule 7–14B arm only if budget and owner-bound policy are explicit; do not reopen V1 or ingest the quarantined distill tree

Runtime-estimate gate: 3 timed pilot instances (all local arms 1.8-3.8s, NIM strong-raw 16-22s) extrapolated to ~12-20min for the full 120-pair grid, well under the 4h cap -> ran the FULL grid, no tranche reduction; actual wall-clock ~14min, 120/120 pairs arm_status=ok (zero infra failures, zero restarts), 0 schema-validation errors
- decision: Bar A (prereg-A v1.1 SS5, sole redefinition-keystone judge) = STOP -- condition 1 (mutating paired win) weak+AIOS 1/18 vs weak+checklist (need >=13/18), McNemar one-sided p=0.999 not significant; conditions 2 and 4 also FAIL, only condition 3 (static equivalence) PASSes. Bar B (ASC-0282 internal 17/24 tie!=win) = FAIL, 1/24 (weak+checklist actually wins more, 10/24). H3 (secondary) fails too: weak+AIOS (0.167) underperforms weak-raw (0.389) under mutation -- worst local arm of the four. Both bars computed on the FULL required arm/instance grid (not partial). Diagnostic: weak+AIOS hits the frozen agent's doom-loop circuit breaker in 18/24 (75%) episodes (vs 4% for weak-raw, 29% checklist, 42% memory) -- monotonic in added scaffold friction, not gate-specific; this is the dominant mechanism behind the STOP, reported as an honest limitation, not used to soften the verdict
- risk: NIM key confirmed never logged (grepped all 120 receipts + run log for the key prefix, zero matches); H2 secondary metric shows a labeling-artifact false-positive (an arm that rarely commits any action looks "cheap" under the wrong-action cost model) -- flagged explicitly in the results doc so it is not misread as calibration-gated abstention working
- next: per prereg SS7, STOP -> propose scope-reduced redefinition to founder; separately, the doom-loop/frozen-agent-resampling-fragility finding suggests a targeted follow-up (does a less brittle resample policy change the verdict) before concluding the epistemic-gate concept itself is dead, per the negative-is-pivot-not-terminus principle
- status: Stage-1 keystone run CLOSED (STOP / FAIL, both bars) -- honest negative, no-launder; full receipts + traces committed for re-analysis

- decision: near-term strongest methodological bets are verifier-gated non-weight skill/case memory, evolutionary program/prompt/tool search with island/Pareto selection, and inference-time search plus weak-verifier ensembles; small-N SFT distillation is likely under-performing because the learned signal is mostly in external search/control/verification traces, not in next-token imitation labels.
- risk: source landscape is fast-moving and several 2026 items are preprints; proposed tests must use external/held-out verifiers and task manifests to avoid self-scoring reward hacking.

- decision: Council is now the first virtual-thread persistence substrate. Browser sessions retain URL handles when available; CLI substrates receive bounded prior transcript context when a `--thread` is reused. PrizeHunter dispatch uses Council by default for codex/claude/gemini/agy-compatible routes and can opt out with `PH_USE_COUNCIL=0`. Hive provider loops can opt in with `AIOS_USE_COUNCIL=1`, producing `council_virtual_thread` receipts.
- risk: native provider session ids for CLI resume are observed in current CLI help but not fully wired into Council execution yet; current durability is universal transcript rehydration plus browser URL handle reuse, not guaranteed native conversation-id resume for every provider. Cross-user federation still needs explicit identity, consent, audit, and revocation contracts before production exposure.
- next: create an AgentNet contract to implement `agentnetd` with identity, consent, envelopes, federation relay, and per-adapter durable session handles; then extend Council adapters to capture native CLI conversation/session ids where each provider safely exposes them.

- goal: unblock Channel-E smoke — both round-2 cells hit 2400 s ollama call timeouts; a trivial 800-token probe also hung >10 min.
- changed: ollama.service — reverted the 2026-07-18 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 pin (its protected tenant is gone: GPU 1 idle at 15 MiB, dacon training moved to remote labserver1_ts); added OLLAMA_SCHED_SPREAD=1 + OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=30m; revert recipe kept in the unit comment.
- evidence: pinned single-GPU state = qwen3-coder-next 31.5 GB on GPU 0 with KV/compute spilled to CPU (runner at ~25 cores, GPU 0%, ~8 tok/s; measured smoke call: 4867 tok in ~620 s). After spread: 26.8+27.0 GB across both 5090s, probe 115.7 tok/s (14x). Note: Phase-5 calibration and pilot ran under the degraded ~8 tok/s serving — their completed results stand, but the 2400 s budget origin (calibration timeouts) was a serving artifact, not model capability.
- decision: spread-across-both-GPUs is the standing config; it also removes the original qwen3:30b OOM-conflict motive (headroom now exists for concurrent loads).
- risk: if a GPU-1 research tenant reappears (quantum arc, on-box dacon fine-tune at 17:00 KST cron), ollama may contend — revert recipe is one comment block away; keep-alive 30m holds VRAM longer (idle-unload after 30m unchanged).

Channel E falsified; per the Mortuary Clause the "compound in the OS" thesis is DEAD across all three transports (theta: 5-seed null; X: pilot n01=0; E: this run). Adversarial post-checks before the verdict: discordance 18.75% (instrument sensitive), mask-miss artifact ruled out (charitable flip still only +3.1pp), mechanism exposure honest (dispatch offered, invoked 0x; mask physically blocked 0 calls - guidance-only). No retry with a new E-mechanism, metric, or task shape.
- risk: N=32 upper bound +12.6pp cannot exclude a small positive (reported, not laundered); dispatch-never-invoked means the null attributes to "offered-but-unused dispatch + guidance-only masking" jointly - stated precisely in the results doc so no stronger claim leaks.
- next: ESCALATED to founder (vision-level): execute the pre-committed re-scope - publish the three-channel null honestly; AIOS = enforced-sovereignty, externally-verified execution substrate with tamper-evident record (what the evidence actually supports).

- goal: execute the pre-committed re-scope after the three-transport null: publish-ready consolidated report, identity redefinition, and the boundary for future intelligence-layer claims.
- changed: docs/AIOS_THREE_CHANNEL_NULL_REPORT_2026-08-01.md (new; publication-ready draft, external posting still founder-gated); docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR.md (RE-SCOPE section prepended - AIOS = enforced-sovereignty, externally-verified execution substrate with tamper-evident record; memory framing marked historical); docs/AIOS_ACTIVE_INFERENCE_PROBE_PREREG_DRAFT_2026-08-01.md (new; status PROPOSED, NOT RUN - tests autonomy, not compounding; Mortuary boundary stated inside).
- evidence: founder GO 2026-08-01 on the 3-part recommendation (re-scope GO / optional probe draft / leaps 2-3 rejected on measured negatives); operator assessment of the founder-supplied 4-gap diagnosis + reframing report against records: Channel-E C=0.000, H1=0 non-vacuous (AIOS_AGENT_INDUCED_H1_RESULTS.md), doom-loop monotone 4->29->42->75%.
- decision: re-scope executed. Leap-2 (runtime H1 forcing) and leap-3 (typed skill compiler) NOT adopted - each collides with a measured negative (no obstruction to repair; friction harms frozen agents; dispatch unused). Active-inference probe left as PROPOSED draft with three open design questions; freezing it is a separate decision.
- risk: north-star doc now carries a dual-era structure (re-scope banner + historical body) - readers must not quote the historical framing as current; the null report's external posting is an outward-facing send and remains founder-gated.
- next: (a) founder decision on freezing/running the active-inference probe; (b) optional scrub-pass + venue choice if the null report goes public; (c) OSS-release framing update to match the re-scoped identity.

- agent: claude@myworld
- role: operator / new arc — AI Society build (founder directive)
- goal: answer the founder's no-society diagnosis (context-reset amnesia + no availability) by building the society layer, converging every idea on one point (AGI as AI-society), with council + subagent grounding.
- changed: docs/AIOS_SOCIETY_GOALTREE_2026-08-02.md (G0 convergence point + G1-G5 subgoals + council landscape/red-team sections); scripts/aios_society.py + tests (G1 arc kernel); scripts/aios_takeover_verify.py + tests (G2); scripts/aios_society_watchdog.py + tests (G3); .aios/society/ (live arcs).
- evidence: 43 tests green (3 suites); LIVE loop on arc-1ed520f47e14 — claude@myworld worked then died, watchdog reclaimed via local qwen3-coder-next MTTR 19.95s, local model restated goal/next-step/constraints from the record alone, separate verifier returned faithful with the arc's pytest oracle green; arc integrity verify ok (9 events, root sha256:8a4155db...); grounding = perplexity landscape (A2A v1.0/LF, Letta, LangGraph, AgentFS, ESAA; 69 sources) + deepseek red-team (6 goodhart attacks, each mapped to INV-1..INV-6) + Explore subagent inventory of existing assets; commits ee42861, 2e5cec3.
- decision: society claims are exactly continuity + availability + verified handoff — the three-channel null forbids any "makes agents smarter" claim, and that boundary is written into the goal tree as an auto-reject test for new ideas. Lease semantics split (write=TTL, takeover=TTL+derived liveness) after a real test failure; arc-id collision bug found by a test and fixed.
- risk: continuity check is lexical (parroting passes) — documented + tested, oracle is the only defence; cross-host liveness has no heartbeat yet (TTL-trusted, recorded honestly); the society's own value claim is UNPROVEN until G5's 3-arm test runs.
- next: G5 pre-registration — 3 arms (solo-restart no-record / solo + ledger / society with handoff+watchdog) under forced context death, primary metric arc completion + MTTR, with the pre-committed concession: if solo+ledger ~= society, dissolve the society and re-converge on storage redesign alone.
- status: in progress (G1-G3 landed, G4-G5 open)
