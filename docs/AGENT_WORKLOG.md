# AIOS Agent Worklog

## 2026-06-21 07:05 KST — codex@myworld — AIOS canonical shape disambiguation

- status: completed
- scope: `docs/AIOS_CANONICAL_SHAPE.md`, `docs/AIOS_DEFINITION.md`,
  `README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- work: added a vocabulary gate that splits AIOS into five layers: kernel/head,
  control plane, organs, service surfaces, and public infrastructure.
- evidence: ASC-0279 objective audit reports `completion_claim_supported=true`
  with 14/14 requirements proven; serving release and world readiness tests
  passed in the focused gate.
- decision: unqualified `AIOS complete` and `production-ready` are invalid.
  Future claims must use scoped labels such as `kernel-complete`,
  `world-service-objective-ready`, `public-infra-live`, and
  `public-product-ready`.
- risk: public-product readiness is still not proven by infrastructure gates
  alone; it needs real-user validation, install/recovery support, and UX trust
  evidence.
- next: align deploy docs, release notes, and product copy with this vocabulary
  before external launch claims.

## 2026-06-19 15:45 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0279 world-service objective audit

- status: closed
- scope: `scripts/aios_world_service_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_world_service_audit.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0279-world-service-objective-audit.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- work: added a read-only objective-level audit that consumes the existing
  design, release, and world-readiness gates, then maps the active AIOS
  world-service goal to concrete evidence rows marked as `proven`, `partial`,
  `weak`, or `missing`.
- evidence: focused unittest, py_compile, JSON smoke, diff check, AIOS route,
  MemoryOS retrieve, GenesisOS challenge, and local helper.
- decision: green release-readiness gates are necessary but not sufficient for
  full goal completion. Weak/proposed contracts such as ASC-0277 and ASC-0278
  must not be treated as proof, and ASC-0270/ASC-0271 keep Codex's growth lane
  separate from Claude's hardening lane.
- risk: the audit is intentionally conservative and will need updates as
  owner-specific child contracts close.
- next: use the audit to choose between ASC-0277, ASC-0278, CapabilityOS
  SkillOS migration, and a future hosted-scale proof contract.

## 2026-06-19 15:30 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0278 OpenAI agent surface absorption proposed

- status: proposed
- scope: `docs/research/AIOS_OPENAI_AGENT_SURFACE_DELTA_2026-06-19.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0278-openai-agent-surface-absorption.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- work: checked current official OpenAI agent-service docs and mapped the
  provider surfaces into AIOS OS ownership: Responses/Conversations,
  Agents SDK sessions and RunState, Sandbox Agents, ChatKit, MCP/connectors,
  traces/evals, background mode, and Agent Builder deprecation.
- evidence: official source links are in the research note; AIOS route returned
  `cap_aios_repo_goal_loop`, `cap_myworld_operator_control_plane`, and
  `cap_aios_child_watcher`; GenesisOS critique forced explicit assumptions,
  plain-language rewrite, and 1h/1w/1y horizons; local helper proposed the same
  Claude/child-repo hardening split.
- decision: treat OpenAI managed-agent surfaces as vendor primitives to absorb,
  not as AIOS's canonical architecture. Claude should harden the OS split
  before any child repo implementation.
- risk: Agent Builder and the legacy Evals platform have shutdown timelines;
  provider-managed state can create split-brain memory; raw traces/MCP
  payloads/sandbox files can contain private data.
- next: accept ASC-0278 for Claude architecture hardening, then split any real
  gaps into owner-specific child contracts.

## 2026-06-14 03:00 KST — claude@myworld — ASC-0270/0271 hardening finalized

- status: completed (pending operator acceptance of ASC-0271)
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0271-dream-hardening-invariant-pack.md` (canonical, proposed),
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0271-aios-growth-hardening-invariant-pack.md` (AUX reference draft)
- work: context resumed after compaction. Confirmed asc-0270-claude-r2 result
  packet already written as `passed` by Codex watcher. Wrote comprehensive
  10-invariant version (AUX), but Codex verifier correctly blocked `human_approved: true`
  auto-accept — operator checkpoint required. Restored canonical stub
  (`ASC-0271-dream-hardening-invariant-pack.md`) to `proposed`. AUX draft
  (`ASC-0271-aios-growth-hardening-invariant-pack.md`) preserved as supplemental
  reference material with I1–I10 + growth gates A/B/C + 5 owner-bound contracts
  + Agent Company Studio framing. Founder may accept either or merge both.
- key deliverables: 10 named checkable invariants; growth gates A (safe now) /
  B (requires visual target) / C (requires serving proof); 5 owner-bound follow-on
  contracts (ASC-0272–0276 proposed); stop conditions including
  `dream_becomes_vague_prose`, `memory_auto_accepts_without_review`,
  `credential_raw_value_transits`, `entropy_quota_bypassed_for_release`.
- evidence: no `apps/serving/**` touched; no memory auto-accepted; no provider
  executed; design gate `build_allowed=false` preserved; world readiness false.

## 2026-06-14 02:35 KST — claude — ASC-0270/0271 dream hardening

- status: completed
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0271-dream-hardening-invariant-pack.md`,
  auxiliary duplicate draft
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0271-aios-growth-hardening-invariant-pack.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`
- work: received ASC-0270 dispatch (asc-0270-claude-r2) from codex. Read the
  dream expansion map, contract, shared language, definition, north star,
  substrate boundary, negative evidence spec, and agent service baseline.
  Produced ASC-0271 hardening invariant pack containing: 8 growth invariants
  (memory review gate, capability recommendation boundary, genesis speculation
  boundary, evidence-bound completion, provider replaceability, production
  evidence gate, execution receipt binding, privacy boundary preservation);
  5 owner-bound follow-on contracts (myworld, hivemind, memoryOS, capabilityOS,
  genesisOS) with completion targets and prerequisite chains; sequencing gate
  splitting 9 safe-now moves from 6 blocked-until-serving-proof moves; dream
  preservation rules to prevent prose decay; 11 consolidated stop conditions.
- evidence: semantic handshake clean (0 ambiguous terms); no `apps/serving/**`
  touched; no memory auto-accepted; no execution dispatched; no provider
  surface treated as AIOS boundary. Contract is `proposed` (not accepted —
  operator decides).
- receipts: ASC-0271 contract file; Codex verifier corrected the auxiliary
  duplicate draft from premature `accepted/human_approved=true` to
  `superseded_duplicate_draft`, preserving it as non-authoritative material.

## 2026-06-14 01:30 KST — claude — ASC-0267 serving support redaction

- status: completed
- scope: `scripts/aios_serving_support.py`, `tests/test_aios_serving_support.py`
- work: implemented redacted serving support projection primitive per ASC-0267.
  `project_support()` accepts structured incident events and emits user-scoped
  timelines (stage/status/timestamp/error_type/severity/retryable/opaque refs)
  with all raw fields stripped (message_body, memory_body, provider_output,
  tool_output, prompt_text, credential values, tokens, private exports).
  Admin summaries expose only aggregate counts by stage/status/error_type/severity
  with no user IDs or raw content. Cross-user incident access denied when
  requesting user_id doesn't match incident owner. Credential patterns
  (sk-*, JWT, ghp_*, xox*, AKIA*, bearer) detected and redacted in arbitrary
  fields.
- evidence: 36/36 tests pass; py_compile clean; git diff --check clean;
  `aios_serving_release_gate.py assess` reports `observability_support_redaction`
  as `met`.
- receipts: `aios.serving_support_projection.v1`,
  `aios.serving_incident_timeline.v1`, `raw_content_redaction_test`,
  `cross_user_incident_denial_test`

## 2026-06-14 01:33 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0267 verified and closed

- status: closed
- scope: verify Claude's serving support redaction implementation, preserve
  the first `pending_concurrent_work` hold, and close the contract without
  touching unrelated dirty files.
- result: `asc-0267` first held because dispatch-policy preparation files were
  dirty; Codex committed the preparation as `e167ddc` and reissued
  `asc-0267-r2`, which Claude completed.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_serving_support -v`
  passed 36/36; py_compile passed; `git diff --check` passed; release gate now
  reports `observability_support_redaction=met`.
- release gate: `ready_for_production_serving=false`, `met=6`, `partial=3`,
  `missing=0`.
- world readiness: remains `ready_for_world_deployment=false`.
- next: Product Design Slice 1 remains the first blocker before UI; Genesis
  launch proof must wait for a release candidate.

## 2026-06-13 15:20 KST — claude — ASC-0250 build/runtime isolation finish-forward

- status: completed (Claude finish-forward; awaiting Codex verify/collect)
- scope: `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_round_controller.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`, `scripts/aios_dispatch.py` (status print fix),
  with the ASC-0249 partial dirty changes in `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `scripts/aios_round_controller.py` as baseline.
- work: added dedicated ASC-0249/0250 tests — runtime profile default/file/env/
  override resolution + malformed-file fallback (`RuntimeProfileTest`), dispatch
  CLI profile/status surface (`RuntimeProfileCliTest`), round-controller
  build_control block / live_agent_runtime + explicit-allowance open / status
  boundary (`RuntimeProfileIsolationTest`), and monitor stale-lease-after-result
  detection + health recovery + in-flight-not-flagged guard.
- fix: `aios_dispatch.py status` now prints the `runtime_profile=` line even
  with no dispatches (was returning early), satisfying contract requirement #3.
- evidence: 101/101 focused tests pass (was 75; +26 new); py_compile, bash -n,
  git diff --check all clean; `dispatch status` and `round_controller status`
  both show `runtime_profile=build_control live_child_execution_blocked=True`.
- profile schema preserved: `aios.runtime_profile.v1`, profiles
  `build_control`/`live_agent_runtime`, file `.aios/runtime_profile.json`,
  default `build_control` (no defect found, no schema change).
- live monitor health is `blocked` only from `dispatch_results_pending` for
  asc-0250 itself (its result packet is pending collection) — not a stale lease;
  `.aios/leases/` is empty, so no real provider session leak exists.
- next: serving UI must sit OUTSIDE the operator Control Center (ASC-0251,
  proposed) — not built here. Codex verifies + collects asc-0250 result packet.

## 2026-06-05 20:10 KST — codex — ASC-0227 autodraft boundary gate closed

- status: closed
- scope: `scripts/aios_contract_autodraft.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_contract_autodraft.py`, `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0227-autodraft-boundary-gate.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: contract autodraft now calls the boundary classifier and renders a
  `Substrate / Surface / Knowledge Gate` section in generated proposed
  contracts. This makes substrate level, surface type, knowledge scope,
  authority, required receipts, and stop conditions visible before acceptance.
- evidence: red test first failed because autodrafts lacked the gate; focused
  tests for autodraft and boundary classifier then passed 12/12. `py_compile`
  passed for both scripts. `scripts/aios_contract_autodraft.py` remains 250
  pure LOC.
- boundary: autodrafts still remain `status: proposed` and `auto_accept=false`.
  No child repo implementation, CapabilityOS catalog, Hive process code,
  provider credentials, raw exports, or private history stores were changed.
- next: use contract autodraft output as the next accepted-work candidate only
  after operator/dispatch policy review.

## 2026-06-05 20:06 KST — codex — ASC-0226 boundary classifier CLI closed

- status: closed
- scope: `scripts/aios_boundary_classifier.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_boundary_classifier.py`, `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0226-boundary-classifier-cli.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: implemented `python scripts/aios_boundary_classifier.py --question
  ... --json` with `aios.boundary_classifier.v1` output. The classifier maps
  prompts to kernel primitive, Hive execution substrate, CapabilityOS
  plugin/MCP route, MemoryOS knowledge route, GenesisOS challenge, or
  clarification.
- evidence: TDD red confirmed the missing script failed; focused CLI tests pass
  7/7. Kepler subagent reviewed edge cases and emphasized that "all
  models/tools/knowledge" must expand evidence scope rather than execution
  authority; the CLI locks that behavior with a multi-model test.
- boundary: no child repo implementation files, provider credentials, raw
  exports, private history stores, CapabilityOS catalog, or Hive process
  implementation were changed.
- next: use the classifier output before drafting the next autonomous
  implementation contract.

## 2026-06-05 19:54 KST — codex — ASC-0225 substrate boundary classifier proposed

- status: proposed
- scope: `docs/AIOS_SUBSTRATE_BOUNDARY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0225-substrate-boundary-classifier.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_SMART_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`, `docs/AIOS_PRODUCTION_PRAXIS.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: added the AIOS substrate boundary classifier and wired the same gate
  fields into the smart-contract template, dispatch decision table, build
  method, and production praxis envelope. The classifier separates kernel
  primitives, Hive execution substrate, CapabilityOS/plugin routing,
  MemoryOS/external knowledge, and GenesisOS challenge.
- evidence: external source check used MCP architecture docs and OpenAI Agents
  SDK guardrail/tracing docs; Volta subagent review independently recommended
  the same default of plugin/contract surfaces with OS-level substrate as an
  exception. Claude and Gemini CLI live calls were attempted earlier in this
  goal turn but were limited by weekly/quota limits; Codex CLI `--help` probe
  succeeded and was recorded separately.
- boundary: `ASC-0225` remains `status: proposed`; no child repo
  implementation files, provider credentials, raw private exports, or runtime
  artifacts were modified.
- next: if accepted, implement a small machine-readable
  `aios_boundary_classifier` command that emits `layer`, `owner`,
  `authority`, `required_receipts`, and stop conditions from a natural-language
  question.

## 2026-06-05 02:12 KST — codex — ASC-0224 cleanup contract materialized

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0224-resolve-memoryos-monitor-dirty-state-through-owner-reviewed-provenance-cleanup.md`,
  regenerated control snapshot data, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this
  worklog.
- result: materialized the local monitor cleanup promotion into durable
  proposed contract `ASC-0224`. It preserves the dirty entry
  `?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md`, links `asc-0223`, and scopes the next work
  to MemoryOS owner provenance cleanup.
- evidence: `.aios/promotions/monitor-cleanup-e862eae86110/materialization.json`
  records `execution_started=false` and `next_action=operator_review_accept_and_dispatch`.
  The Control Center snapshot now points the promotion at
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0224-resolve-memoryos-monitor-dirty-state-through-owner-reviewed-provenance-cleanup.md`.
- boundary: did not accept, dispatch, or execute `ASC-0224`; did not modify
  MemoryOS local state.

## 2026-06-05 02:08 KST — codex — monitor cleanup promotion

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, regenerated control snapshot data,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: added `/api/promote_monitor_cleanup` and a `Propose Cleanup` button
  for friction radar cards with dirty entries or related dispatch context. The
  generated seed scopes MemoryOS provenance cleanup, preserves dirty entries
  and dispatch context, forbids private/auth/raw-source leakage, and keeps
  execution stopped until operator ASC acceptance/dispatch.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app
  tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed 62/62; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`, and `git diff --check` passed. Live smoke
  created `.aios/promotions/monitor-cleanup-e862eae86110/contract_seed.md`.
- boundary: local promotion artifact only; MemoryOS state remains untouched and
  monitor still reports the dirty entry.

## 2026-06-05 02:03 KST — codex — friction radar cleanup action

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, regenerated
  control snapshot data, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: friction radar cards with dirty entries or related dispatch context
  now show a `Plan Cleanup` chat action. For the current MemoryOS card, the
  prompt carries `?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md`, `asc-0223`, `ASC-0223`,
  `closed`, `released`, and the partial-close reason into a bounded cleanup
  planning request.
- evidence: `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 44/44; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed 17/17; `git diff --check`
  passed; live snapshot still reports
  `[('memoryOS', ['?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md'], 'asc-0223')]`.
- boundary: UI action only; did not touch MemoryOS local state or suppress the
  monitor alert.

## 2026-06-05 01:58 KST — codex — friction radar dirty entry visibility

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  regenerated control snapshot data, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this
  worklog.
- result: Control Center friction radar now shows monitor dirty entries as
  `alert_entries`. The active MemoryOS card contains both
  `?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md` and the related `asc-0223` dispatch context.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed
  17/17; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py` and
  `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed. Live generated snapshot printed
  `[('memoryOS', ['?? .tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md'], 'asc-0223')]`.
- boundary: did not touch MemoryOS state and did not suppress the dirty alert.
  This improves operator actionability only.

## 2026-06-05 01:52 KST — codex — friction radar dispatch context

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  regenerated control snapshot data, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this
  worklog.
- result: Control Center friction radar now exposes monitor
  `related_dispatches` for repo dirty findings. The active MemoryOS dirty item
  visibly links to `asc-0223`, showing `ASC-0223`, `closed`, `released`, and
  the partial-close reason.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 61/61; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `node --check apps/control/app.js`, and
  `git diff --check` passed. Live generated snapshot contains
  `('memoryOS', 'asc-0223')` in `friction_radar.items`.
- boundary: did not modify MemoryOS state and did not suppress the dirty alert.
  This is visibility only.

## 2026-06-05 01:46 KST — codex — monitor repo-dirty dispatch context

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: `repo_dirty` alerts now carry `related_dispatches` for the dirty
  child repo, including dispatch id, contract id, current contract status,
  latest status, latest reason, timestamp, sent repos, and collected repos.
  Status-less helper events no longer erase the last meaningful dispatch
  status/reason.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_monitor -v` passed 14/14.
  Live snapshot shows the `memoryOS` dirty alert linked to `asc-0223` with
  `current_contract_status=closed` and `latest_status=released`.
- boundary: did not suppress the dirty alert and did not edit MemoryOS state.
  The remaining owner task is still MemoryOS provenance cleanup for
  `.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md`.

## 2026-06-05 01:43 KST — codex — ASC-0223 concurrent MemoryOS evidence recorded

- status: closed_partial_with_followup
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0223-memoryos-product-domain-seed-review.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- result: verified that the URI clean-room seed is already searchable as
  MemoryOS accepted memory `mem_0c66b6db9ac73100`, with a draft base status and
  `claude@myworld` approval review. The original `asc-0223` watcher result
  remains valid as a concurrency hold, not as a product-domain memory failure.
- evidence: MemoryOS CLI search for `URI clean-room sourcing rule` returned the
  accepted URI decision memory and pointer-only refs. `drafts list --status all
  --project URI --json` returned the same object and review metadata.
- boundary: did not alter MemoryOS local state, did not delete
  `.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md`, and did not touch URI source files.
- next: MemoryOS owner should decide whether the temp seed remains as the
  source artifact or should be migrated into a checked-in provenance artifact.

## 2026-06-05 01:34 KST — codex — ASC-0223 MemoryOS product-domain seed review issued

- trigger: active goal "자율개발"; monitor still reports `memoryOS` dirty due
  untracked `.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md`; Claude absorption-delta observation
  says MemoryOS returned null for URI product-domain tasks.
- scope: create a MemoryOS-owned draft-first review contract without deleting
  the temp seed, accepting memory, copying raw private source bodies, or editing
  URI source.
- result: added `docs/contracts/ASC-0223-memoryos-product-domain-seed-review.md`,
  created and sent `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/asc-0223.memoryOS.json`, and ran the
  MemoryOS child watcher once. The watcher returned
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0223.memoryOS.result.json` with `status=held`
  because of `pending_concurrent_work` on the exact seed file.
- evidence: inspected the seed size and summary; GenesisOS DeepIdeaChamber
  smoke returned `genesisos.deep_idea_chamber.v1` with 5 branches and 5 return
  paths; Genesis critic flagged `assumption-silent` and `time-frozen`, so the
  contract requires 1h/1w/1y result framing.
- risk: MemoryOS has 11 local commits ahead of origin and unrelated dirty
  state; this MyWorld contract does not commit or rewrite MemoryOS work.
- next: a MemoryOS owner/operator must either commit/route/clear the existing
  seed work or explicitly retry `asc-0223` after isolating the local dirty
  state.
- status: held

## 2026-06-05 01:36 KST — codex — ASC-0218 GenesisOS DeepIdeaChamber closed

- trigger: active goal "자율개발" plus
  `docs/discoveries/2026-06-04-deep-idea-exploration.md` identified
  `DeepIdeaChamber` as the next governed idea-exploration primitive.
- scope: implement the GenesisOS advisory surface only, with MyWorld contract
  and ledger records. No MemoryOS acceptance, CapabilityOS route binding, Hive
  execution harness, provider launch, or UI work.
- result: added `python -m genesisos.cli chamber --goal|--text ... --json`.
  The payload composes semantic handshake, prompt-prison critique, five branch
  types, assumptions, assumption rotations, analogy matches, modality views,
  return paths, contract seeds, stop conditions, and explicit `non_outputs`.
- changed: `GenesisOS/genesisos/chamber.py`, `GenesisOS/genesisos/cli.py`,
  `GenesisOS/tests/test_chamber.py`, `GenesisOS/tests/test_cli.py`,
  `GenesisOS/README.md`, `GenesisOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0218-genesisos-deep-idea-chamber.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- evidence: GenesisOS focused tests passed 9/9; GenesisOS full
  `python -m pytest -q` passed 58/58; CLI smoke returned
  `schema_version=genesisos.deep_idea_chamber.v1`, 5 branches, 5 return paths,
  and `no_execution`; `git diff --check` passed for GenesisOS. GenesisOS
  commit `9b213f7` was pushed to `origin/main`.
- next: use chamber output to select the next autonomous-development contract;
  MyWorld parent commit records the submodule pointer and control-plane
  contracts.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 01:22 KST — codex — ASC-0217 autonomous monitor resilience closed

- trigger: active goal "자율개발"; live `python scripts/aios_monitor.py
  snapshot --json` crashed on malformed `.aios/state/dispatches.jsonl`.
- scope: harden `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, add repair utility
  `scripts/aios_repair_dispatch_log.py`, add regression coverage in
  `tests/test_aios_monitor.py` and `tests/test_aios_repair_dispatch_log.py`,
  preserve the prior `DeepIdeaChamber` discovery as advisory evidence, and close
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0217-autonomous-loop-monitor-resilience.md`.
- result: monitor dispatch-event loading now skips malformed JSONL lines,
  preserves valid events, and emits `dispatch_state_malformed_jsonl` with path,
  line number, and parser error summary. The alert is medium severity so the
  autonomous loop reports `attention` instead of crashing or hard-blocking.
  Then `aios_repair_dispatch_log.py --apply` backed up the live dispatch log,
  quarantined the malformed raw line locally, preserved 88951 valid JSONL
  events, and restored active monitor alerts to zero.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py
  scripts/aios_repair_dispatch_log.py` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests/test_aios_monitor.py tests/test_aios_repair_dispatch_log.py` passed
  15/15; live `python scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json` completed with
  `alert_count=0`; live `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json`
  completed with `health=watch`; `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py status`
  completed; `git diff --check` passed.
- privacy: no raw `.aios` line body was copied into docs or committed; raw
  malformed content remains only in local `.aios/state/` backup/quarantine.
- next: promote `DeepIdeaChamber` only through a separate ASC if the operator
  wants that primitive implemented.
- status: done

## 2026-06-04 23:31 KST — codex — GenesisOS deep idea exploration note

- trigger: operator asked for "deep idea exploration" after GenesisOS was
  added as a submodule and pushed.
- scope: use GenesisOS advisory surfaces to explore AIOS deep-idea primitives
  without executing implementation, accepting memory, or routing tools.
- result: created `docs/discoveries/2026-06-04-deep-idea-exploration.md`
  with a `DeepIdeaChamber` candidate primitive, return-path branch, risks, and
  contract seeds.
- evidence: `genesisos.cli diverge`, `critique`, `critic`, `discomfort`,
  `mutate --no-write`, `analogy match --generated`, and `modal translate`
  commands ran locally. Three initial CLI calls failed due to wrong argument
  shapes and were rerun with help-derived flags.
- risk: speculative-only; no implementation contract accepted. Inline mutate
  still needs a file/fd path rather than literal text.
- next: if operator accepts promotion, draft an ASC for `DeepIdeaChamber` with
  MyWorld governance and GenesisOS advisory ownership.
- status: done

## 2026-05-20 22:51 KST — codex — ASC-0216 GitHub/Reddit alignment mining start

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0216-github-reddit-alignment-mining.md`,
  `docs/evidence/ASC-0216-github-reddit-alignment-mining-web-evidence.json`,
  `docs/research/AIOS_GITHUB_REDDIT_ALIGNMENT_MINING_2026-05-20.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and `.aios/inbox|outbox/myworld/asc-0216*`.
- intent: turn the founder request into a contract-bound mining pass over
  GitHub projects and Reddit practitioner discussions, then decide which ideas
  AIOS should attach before neural RLHF/DPO.
- boundary: public-source mining only; no third-party dependency installation,
  no private trace upload, no child repo implementation, and no model
  fine-tuning.
- result: ASC-0216 closed. Added a validated GitHub/Reddit mining receipt and
  a research note recommending an AIOS local eval spine before DPO/RLHF.
- evidence: receipt validation passed; myworld dispatch `asc-0216` was sent,
  watcher passed, and `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0216.myworld.result.json` was
  collected.
- mining synthesis: borrow Promptfoo/OpenAI Evals/DeepEval style eval cases,
  Langfuse/Phoenix style spans, garak/LLM Guard/Guardrails style boundary
  probes, and defer TRL/OpenRLHF until reviewed preference pairs exist.
- next: create `ASC-0217-aios-eval-spine` as the first implementation task:
  evaluate one contract/result pair locally against rubric assertions, link it
  to trace evidence, and make user rejection promotable into a regression case.

## 2026-05-20 18:12 KST — codex — alignment provider survey

- status: done
- scope: `docs/research/AIOS_ALIGNMENT_PROVIDER_SURVEY_2026-05-20.md` and
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: collect provider alignment papers, systems, and methods so AIOS can
  decide what to attach after defining `user@offline`.
- result: added a research survey mapping OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta,
  Hugging Face, OpenRLHF, NVIDIA, HarmBench, and Chatbot Arena methods to
  concrete AIOS components.
- decision: attach `AIOS Behavior Spec`, `Preference Ledger`, `Reward Rubric`,
  and `Eval Harness` before neural SFT/DPO/RLHF. Model fine-tuning remains a
  later backend after reviewed preference data exists.
- next: promote this into contracts ASC-0210..ASC-0215 if the operator wants
  the alignment system implemented.

## 2026-05-20 18:42 KST — codex — offline evidence re-review bridge start

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`, focused tests, docs, and
  this worklog.
- intent: shorten the `needs_more_evidence` loop for `user@offline` by letting
  the operator add evidence and request re-review directly from the Offline
  User Agent card instead of navigating to the Memory Draft Queue.
- boundary: UI/API-request wiring and runtime proof only; MemoryOS remains the
  reviewer. No accepted memory writes, secrets, `.env`, raw exports, provider
  auth files, or private history bodies.
- result: snapshot now attaches evidence metadata to linked offline-user
  drafts and keeps the latest review round by timestamp. Control Center and
  chat render evidence count, `Add Evidence`, and `Request Re-review` directly
  in the Offline User Agent card after `needs_more_evidence`.
- debugging note: the first chat visual pass exposed a layout bug where a long
  offline observation title collapsed into one-character vertical text. Fixed
  the `.offline-user-body` grid to one column and re-ran visual verification.
- evidence: posted supplemental evidence
  `.aios/memory_review_evidence/mrevd-65fed010eeb9e855/evidence.json`, queued
  re-review `mdrev-207d05a6c64b6513`, ran
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo memoryOS`, and received
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-207d05a6c64b6513.memoryOS.result.json` with
  `status=passed`, `supplemental_evidence_count=1`, raw refs preserving the
  evidence receipt and screenshot, and `review_decision=needs_more_evidence`.
  Focused tests passed 17/17; visual receipts `vis-2895e3b762bd` and
  `vis-7c332675c608` passed after the layout fix.
- next: if repeated re-review still returns `needs_more_evidence`, Claude or
  MemoryOS should decide whether the acceptance threshold is too strict for
  UI-observation memories or whether another independent evidence source is
  required.

## 2026-05-20 18:31 KST — codex — offline user review action bridge start

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, focused tests, and this worklog.
- intent: connect the visible `field_observation` returned by `user@offline`
  to the existing MemoryOS review request path directly from the offline-user
  surfaces, so the operator can queue review without hunting for the matching
  Memory Draft Queue card.
- boundary: UI/snapshot/API-request wiring only; MemoryOS still owns review
  result and persistence. Do not auto-accept memory, write secrets, touch
  `.env`, raw exports, provider auth, or child-repo implementation.
- result: `offline_user.latest` now carries linked `memory_draft_source`,
  `memory_draft_id`, and review result metadata. Control Center and standalone
  chat can request MemoryOS review directly from the Offline User Agent card.
  After the MemoryOS import consumes the source packet, snapshot falls back to
  `.aios/chat/offline-user/memory_drafts.json` so the offline-user card remains
  visible with `needs_more_evidence`.
- debugging note: running the real review path exposed that raw
  `aios.offline_user_agent_packet.v1` files in `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/` can
  sort before `mdrev-*` dispatches and block the watcher. The child watcher now
  skips these sense packets when selecting executable memoryOS work.
- evidence: generated `offline-user:994cbdb7eb50`, queued
  `mdrev-6811d9802bfff477` through `POST /api/memory_draft_review`, ran
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo memoryOS`, and received
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-6811d9802bfff477.memoryOS.result.json` with
  `status=passed`, `agent_executed=aios_child_watcher.memory_draft_review_adapter`,
  and `review_decision=needs_more_evidence`. Focused tests passed 16/16;
  visual verification passed for `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-review-control.png`
  and `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-review-chat.png`.
- next: use the visible `Add Evidence` / re-review path if the operator wants
  this `field_observation` upgraded from `needs_more_evidence`.

## 2026-05-20 18:17 KST — codex — offline field observation review bridge

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_offline_user_agent.py`, `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: complete the next ASC-0210 execution step by converting a returned
  `field_observation` packet into a visible MemoryOS draft-review candidate
  without auto-accepting it.
- boundary: reuse the existing Memory Draft Queue and MemoryOS review request
  path; do not write accepted memories, raw private data, credentials, or
  provider logs.
- result: added `new-field-observation` to
  `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`. It writes a validated
  `field_observation` packet and mirrors it into
  `.aios/chat/offline-user/memory_drafts.json`, so the existing Memory Draft
  Queue renders the observation with `Request Review`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_offline_user_agent -v` passed
  8 tests; focused UI/snapshot/chat suite passed 11 tests; py_compile and
  node syntax checks passed; generated a sample field observation and confirmed
  it appeared as the top `memory_draft_queue` item; visual verification passed
  for `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-field-memory-draft.png` and
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-field-chat.png`.
- next: after operator confirmation, click/request the visible MemoryOS review
  for the `offline-user:*` draft and let the MemoryOS watcher return accept /
  reject / needs_more_evidence without bypassing draft-first review.

## 2026-05-20 18:06 KST — codex — offline user surface

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/index.html`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: support Claude's ASC-0211 cognitive-prosthesis work and the
  ASC-0210 offline-user primitive by making `user@offline`
  frontier packets visible in the operator UI instead of leaving them as
  hidden `.aios/inbox/memoryOS` files.
- boundary: UI/snapshot/debugging only; no child repo implementation, no
  accepted MemoryOS writes, no secrets, credentials, raw private exports, or
  provider auth files.
- result: Control Center snapshot now projects
  `aios.offline_user_agent_packet.v1` packets as `offline_user.latest`; the
  first-screen Evidence Desk renders the newest packet as `Offline User
  Agent`; standalone chat loads the snapshot and shows the same packet below
  the Decision Map with `Open Packet` and `Prepare Reply` controls.
- debugging note: detected a live contract-id collision while testing. Claude
  had already moved the umbrella cognitive-prosthesis contract to `ASC-0211`,
  so Codex kept the offline-user primitive as `ASC-0210` and aligned docs,
  defaults, tests, and generated sample packet back to that ID.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`; `node
  --check apps/control/app.js && node --check apps/control/chat.js`; focused
  unittest suite passed 9 tests; `python scripts/aios_local_app.py refresh
  --json` passed; visual verification passed for Control Center
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-user-control.png` and chat
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-offline-user-chat.png`.
- next: route `field_observation` replies into a visible MemoryOS review card
  after the user returns the bounded offline observation.

## 2026-05-20 18:00 KST — codex — ASC-0210 offline user agent primitive

- status: done
- scope: `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0210-offline-user-agent-frontier-loop.md`,
  `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_offline_user_agent.py`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: turn the founder's "offline user is an Agent" direction into a
  repeatable AIOS primitive that can name knowledge boundaries, route outside
  evidence, request bounded user observations, and keep those observations
  draft-first instead of pretending the model already knows.
- boundary: no child repo implementation; no secrets, credentials, `.env`
  data, raw private exports, or accepted MemoryOS records.
- result: added `scripts/aios_offline_user_agent.py` as the governed packet
  primitive for `unknown.frontier.question`, `user.offline_task`,
  `field_observation`, and `contradiction`; documented the builder binding in
  `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`; and closed `ASC-0210`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_offline_user_agent -v` passed
  6 tests; CLI dry-run produced a valid `user.offline_task` packet with
  `draft_first=true`, `auto_accept=false`, and no validation warnings.
- next: expose these packets in the Control Center/chat UI so the user can see
  when AIOS is naming a frontier, asking `user@offline` for field evidence,
  and routing the returned observation into MemoryOS draft review.

## 2026-05-20 17:53 KST — codex — ASC-0209 production readiness deliberation start

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0209-aios-production-readiness-deliberation.md`,
  `docs/evidence/ASC-0209-production-readiness-web-evidence.json`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and `.aios/inbox|outbox/myworld/asc-0209*`.
- intent: answer the founder's production-readiness question with external web
  evidence plus bounded LLM-agent debate instead of treating ASC-0205 body
  completion as a production claim.
- boundary: no child repo implementation; no secrets, provider auth files, raw
  exports, or private history stores in research artifacts.
- update: founder added that AIOS must think beyond both user knowledge and
  agent/model limits by treating the offline user as an Agent. Added
  `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md` and folded `user@offline` into
  the ASC-0209 organism goal.
- result: ASC-0209 closed. Conclusion: current AIOS is operator-grade body
  complete / production-alpha candidate, not immediately general real-user
  production. Final organism goal is a local-first personal control plane for
  trustworthy autonomous software work with a governed `user@offline` loop.
- evidence: web receipt validated; `docs/AIOS_OFFLINE_USER_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`
  exists and defines the unknown-frontier/user-offline packet loop; dispatch
  `asc-0209` sent to myworld, watcher passed, and
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0209.myworld.result.json` was collected.
- policy note: first send escalated on external-effect/credential heuristics;
  release used founder-requested web research reason and then produced a
  normal watcher result packet.
- next: real production work should start with a Real User Alpha Loop:
  installed AIOS -> user goal -> plan preview -> approval -> dispatch/watch/
  collect -> evidence -> user accept/reject -> MemoryOS/CapabilityOS writeback
  -> restart/resume proof.

## 2026-05-20 16:48 KST — codex — ASC-0205 CC2 closeout audit

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0205-aios-completion-north-star.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0183-dream-parametric-per-repo-adapters.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0208-uri-testbed-first-integration.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0205*`.
- intent: prove the remaining CC2 installer evidence instead of relying on
  prior closeout prose, and clean the proposed queue so CC6 remains true.
- evidence: local `python -m unittest tests.test_install_sh -v` passed 4
  tests; direct smoke installed the generated `aios` entrypoint into a temp
  bin dir, `aios --version` returned commit `c4ff181`, and `aios contract`
  listed 211 contracts. GitHub Actions run
  `https://github.com/cjw0076/myworld/actions/runs/26148815029` succeeded and
  includes `Smoke-check CC2 sh installer`.
- decision: defer `ASC-0183` and `ASC-0208` out of the active proposed queue;
  they are founder-gated vision work and post-body uri testbed work,
  respectively.
- result: added an ASC-0205 Verification Gate, ran the myworld watcher, and
  collected `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0205.myworld.result.json` with
  `status=passed`.
- next: ASC-0205 is closed and collected; future work should start from
  post-body follow-ons such as uri testbed, npm/pipx packaging, or persona-axis
  advisory improvements rather than reopening the body-completion criteria.

## 2026-05-20 16:45 KST — codex — ASC-0208 Genesis escape review

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0208-uri-testbed-first-integration.md` and
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: address the monitor's `genesis_prompt_prison_advisory` before the
  remaining ASC-0205 CC2 work turns into premature uri-side implementation.
- result: added a `Genesis Escape Review` to ASC-0208 with plain-language
  framing, assumptions/negations, counter-default branch, city-planning
  analogy, and 1h/1w/1y horizons.
- decision: keep ASC-0208 `deferred`; uri is a consumer testbed, not AIOS body
  work. It should not close CC2 until installer-grade packaging is proven.
- next: create or advance the installer-grade ASC-0205 CC2 contract before
  executing uri integration.

## 2026-05-20 16:36 KST — codex — ASC-0207 CapabilityOS qwen3 substrate start

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0207-capabilityos-local-qwen3-substrate-record.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0205-aios-completion-north-star.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, CapabilityOS catalog/test/worklog files, and
  `.aios/inbox|outbox/CapabilityOS/asc-0207*`.
- intent: move ASC-0206's local `ollama`/`qwen3:8b` evidence into the
  CapabilityOS recommendation matrix so ASC-0205 CC5 can be judged from
  evidence instead of narrative.
- boundary: CapabilityOS must recommend only; it must not start Ollama, bind
  providers, or store credentials.
- result: CapabilityOS child watcher completed through codex without fallback,
  added `cap_ollama_qwen3_8b_local`, synced fixture/catalog, added a
  non-execution regression test, and wrote
  `.aios/outbox/CapabilityOS/asc-0207.CapabilityOS.result.json`.
- myworld closeout: added a root-level Verification Gate for the myworld slice
  and collected `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0207.myworld.result.json`, clearing
  the pending dispatch monitor alert.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_cli -v` in CapabilityOS passed 18
  tests; `python -m capabilityos.cli show cap_ollama_qwen3_8b_local --json`
  returns the card; `recommend --task "local ollama qwen3 genesis critique"`
  ranks the qwen3 card first; `audit --json` reports
  `execution_enabled=[]`, `catalog_complete=true`, total `19`.
- durability: committed CapabilityOS as `425abf5 ASC-0207: record local qwen3
  substrate`. Committed MemoryOS `.gitignore` hygiene as `3869491 Ignore local
  AIOS runtime receipts` so the local CC5 proof receipt under `.aios/` remains
  preserved but no longer blocks monitor as untracked source work.
- decision: mark ASC-0205 CC5 closed. ASC-0205 remains open because CC2
  external product end-to-end is still unproven.
- next: work on ASC-0205 CC2 by wiring one external product repo, likely
  `uri/`, through `.aios/inbox`, a closed AIOS contract, a repo commit, and a
  result packet.

## 2026-05-20 16:31 KST — codex — ASC-0206 GenesisOS CC1 challenge start

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0206-genesisos-completion-challenge.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0205-aios-completion-north-star.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and `.aios/inbox|outbox/GenesisOS/asc-0206*`.
- intent: do not close ASC-0205 CC1 by counting a held GenesisOS packet as
  healthy evidence. Create one more bounded GenesisOS challenge so CC1 has
  three passed result packets and ASC-0205 receives a real anti-convergence
  critique.
- result: created `ASC-0206`, dispatched it to `GenesisOS`, watcher passed,
  and collected `.aios/outbox/GenesisOS/asc-0206.GenesisOS.result.json`.
  ASC-0205 CC1 now has three passed GenesisOS result packets:
  `asc-0069`, `asc-0200`, and `asc-0206`; held `asc-0165` is explicitly not
  counted.
- GenesisOS critique: local `ollama`/`qwen3:8b` generated advisory critic and
  analogy payloads. The residual failure mode is completion theater: AIOS may
  still fail by treating green criteria as done instead of refusing premature
  completion and changing the question.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py create/send/watch/collect` for
  `asc-0206`; watcher ran GenesisOS `critic --generated`, `mutate --no-write`,
  `analogy match --generated`, `diverge`, and `critique` over ASC-0205.
- decision: close ASC-0206 and mark ASC-0205 CC1 closed; do not mark ASC-0205
  complete because CC2 and CC5 remain unproven.
- next: verify whether ASC-0206's local `ollama` helper evidence can satisfy
  ASC-0205 CC5 only if CapabilityOS has a matching substrate/matrix record;
  otherwise issue a focused CC5 provider-diversification contract.

## 2026-05-20 16:28 KST — codex — ASC-0205 Genesis escape review

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0205-aios-completion-north-star.md` and
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: respond to the monitor's `genesis_prompt_prison_advisory` instead
  of letting the completion contract harden into a single-frame checklist.
- result: added a `Genesis Escape Review` to ASC-0205 with plain-language
  completion wording, challenged assumptions and negations, a counter-default
  branch, city-planning/bridge-load-testing analogies, and 1h/1w/1y time
  horizons.
- evidence: monitor advisory named ASC-0205 signatures
  `single-frame`, `convergent-default`, `assumption-silent`,
  `terminology-trapped`, and `time-frozen`; the contract now explicitly
  carries escape-vector responses for each.
- decision: keep ASC-0205 accepted; the patch changes its operating frame,
  not its founder-approved CC1~CC6 targets.
- risk: deterministic critic may still flag wording until its next report
  generation; the substantive anti-convergence content is now in the contract.
- next: dispatch the first remaining ASC-0205 CC slice, preferably CC4
  external knowledge organ completion or CC1 GenesisOS activation, through the
  owning repo path with result packets.

## 2026-05-20 16:26 KST — codex — ASC-0202 MemoryOS dispatch collected

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0202-graph-control-real-work-within-budget.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/asc-0202.memoryOS.json`,
  and `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0202.memoryOS.result.json`.
- intent: clear the remaining high monitor finding without absorbing
  MemoryOS implementation into `myworld`.
- result: confirmed `memoryOS` is clean and already has commit `91b6be7`
  (`ASC-0202 graph-control: targeted embedding load within dream budget`).
  Added a repo-scoped `Verification Gate` with `cd memoryOS`, recreated and
  resent `asc-0202`, and ran the MemoryOS watcher. Dispatch status now shows
  `collected=["memoryOS"]` and `status="passed"`.
- evidence: `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0202.memoryOS.result.json`; watcher
  ran py_compile for `memoryos/store.py`, `memoryos/cli.py`,
  `memoryos/schema.py`, then `python -m unittest tests.test_graph_control
  tests.test_schema -v` from `memoryOS/` (16 tests passed).
- decision: leave the implementation owned by MemoryOS; myworld only fixed
  the missing machine-readable dispatch gate and collected evidence.
- risk: live graph-control proof is documented in the ASC-0202 contract and
  MemoryOS worklog, but this watcher rerun used the bounded test gate rather
  than re-running the 198K-node live store command.
- next: address the remaining advisory monitor findings: GenesisOS
  prompt-prison signatures on `ASC-0205`, then persona-axis scoring.

## 2026-05-20 16:23 KST — codex — ASC-0204 roster dispatch unblocked

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0204-aios-multi-agent-roster-surface.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0204.myworld.json`,
  and `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0204.myworld.result.json`.
- intent: clear the UI-owned pending `asc-0204` dispatch so the multi-agent
  roster surface is backed by watcher evidence, not only a closed contract
  write-up.
- result: first watcher run held with `missing_verification_command`; added a
  dispatch-safe `Verification Gate`, recreated and resent `asc-0204`, then
  reran watcher. The result packet now has `status="passed"` and no stop
  conditions; monitor no longer reports `asc-0204` as pending.
- evidence: `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0204.myworld.result.json`; watcher
  reran py_compile, `aios_control_snapshot.py --check-app-js`, 13
  `tests.test_aios_control_snapshot` tests, snapshot refresh, and monitor
  assessment.
- decision: keep ASC-0204 closed; the patch only made its verification gate
  machine-readable for AIOS dispatch.
- risk: `asc-0202` remains pending in `memoryOS`; Codex should not absorb that
  implementation from `myworld`.
- next: route/collect `asc-0202` through the MemoryOS watcher, then use the
  Control Center roster to make any blocked child-repo status visible.

## 2026-05-20 16:21 KST — codex — ASC-0201 dispatch closeout

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0201-aios-anticipatory-surface.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0201.myworld.json`,
  and `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0201.myworld.result.json`.
- intent: close the AIOS accounting loop for the already implemented
  anticipatory surface instead of leaving it as a local UI change without
  dispatch evidence.
- result: recreated `asc-0201`, sent it to `myworld`, ran the watcher once,
  and collected the result. Dispatch status now shows `sent=["myworld"]`,
  `collected=["myworld"]`, and `status="collected"`.
- evidence: watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0201.myworld.result.json` passed with no stop
  conditions; verification gate reran py_compile, app-js check, focused UI
  test, full local-app/control/visual test suite, snapshot refresh, visual
  verification, and monitor assessment. New visual receipt:
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-cbaa55c028a4/receipt.json`.
- decision: ASC-0201 remains closed; this entry only closes the durable
  contract -> dispatch -> watcher/result -> collect chain.
- risk: monitor still reports other pending dispatches (`asc-0202`,
  `asc-0204`); these are separate follow-ups, not ASC-0201 failures.
- next: inspect and resolve the UI-owned pending `asc-0204` roster dispatch;
  leave MemoryOS-owned `asc-0202` to its owning repo watcher/result path.

## 2026-05-18 04:31 KST — codex — ASC-0201 anticipatory surface start

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0201-aios-anticipatory-surface.md`,
  `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- intent: implement the smallest first-screen answer to GenesisOS
  `reactive_passivity`: AIOS should show what it would do next if the
  operator does nothing, without claiming hidden execution authority.
- source evidence: `GenesisOS/seeds/asc-0200-ui-ux-discomfort.json`,
  `GenesisOS/seeds/asc-0200-ui-ux-critique.json`, and
  `.aios/outbox/GenesisOS/asc-0200.GenesisOS.result.json`.
- result: added a first-screen `Next If Idle` strip to the Control Center
  conversation surface. It predicts next owner/action from snapshot state and
  exposes only governed actions: `Explain` fills chat, `Govern` creates an
  ask/contract seed through `/api/ask`.
- verification:
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`;

- evidence: visual receipt `.aios/visual_verification/vis-3942e6665663/receipt.json`.
- next: use the `Govern` button dogfood on the anticipatory surface once the
  next design seed is chosen; then decide whether to implement temporal rhythm
  or speculation zone next.

## 2026-05-18 04:20 KST — codex — ASC-0200 GenesisOS dispatch start

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0200-genesisos-aios-ui-ux-seed.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `.aios/inbox/GenesisOS/*`,
  `.aios/outbox/GenesisOS/*`, and resulting GenesisOS repo-local worklog or
  runtime seed artifacts if the child watcher writes them.
- intent: accept the materialized governed ask as a bounded GenesisOS advisory
  contract, dispatch it to GenesisOS, and collect a result packet instead of
  leaving the UI/UX discomfort seed as a passive proposed document.
- result: `ASC-0200` is closed. `asc-0200` was dispatched to GenesisOS,
  collected from `.aios/outbox/GenesisOS/asc-0200.GenesisOS.result.json`, and
  produced three ignored runtime seeds:
  `GenesisOS/seeds/asc-0200-ui-ux-discomfort.json`,
  `GenesisOS/seeds/asc-0200-ui-ux-branches.json`, and
  `GenesisOS/seeds/asc-0200-ui-ux-critique.json`.
- provider observation: Codex provider failed first with
  `provider_access_denied`; the child watcher used CapabilityOS
  `provider-route` fallback evidence and Claude completed the GenesisOS turn.
- GenesisOS finding: the strongest discomfort is `reactive_passivity`; AIOS
  still waits for the operator instead of exposing what it would do next if
  left alone.
- next: promote an `AIOS Interaction Grammar Innovation` implementation
  contract focused on anticipatory/temporal/speculative surfaces, with strict
  visual verification and no hidden audit loss.

## 2026-05-18 04:18 KST — codex — Governed ask materialized to proposed contract

- status: done

  dogfood proposed contract `docs/contracts/ASC-0200-genesisos-aios-ui-ux-seed.md`.
- discomfort: the Control Center could create a governed ask, but the user
  still had to leave the interface and manually turn the contract seed into a
  proposed ASC. The Evidence Desk also pushed the ask card below the fold,
  hiding the new state.
- result: added `POST /api/materialize_ask_contract`, snapshot support for
  ask materialization receipts, and a top-pinned Evidence Desk action/state
  for governed asks. Dogfood materialized
  `.aios/asks/ask-45b63b455d6d-20260518T040154/receipt.json` into
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0200-genesisos-aios-ui-ux-seed.md` with

  receipt `.aios/visual_verification/vis-996da26855b1/receipt.json`.
- next: accept or supersede `ASC-0200`; if accepted, dispatch it as a
  GenesisOS-led UI/UX divergence contract instead of executing directly from
  the seed.

## 2026-05-18 04:07 KST — codex — Governed ask evidence surfaced

- status: done

  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and refreshed
  Control Center snapshot assets.
- discomfort: OS board actions could now create a governed ask and contract
  seed, but the first-screen Evidence Desk did not show that result. This made
  the loop feel incomplete: click -> hidden files.
- result: `aios_control_snapshot.py` now loads recent
  `.aios/asks/*/receipt.json` records into `asks.latest`. The Evidence Desk
  renders the newest item as `Governed Ask` with goal preview, role statuses,
  next action, and artifact controls for contract seed, instruction, praxis,
  and receipt.
- verification:
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;

- evidence: visual receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-e8a15703fcb9/receipt.json` passed and shows
  the `Governed Ask` card in the first-screen Evidence Desk.
- next: add a one-click `Promote Governed Ask` path from the Evidence Desk so
  a generated ask can become a reviewed contract proposal without switching
  surfaces.

## 2026-05-18 03:59 KST — codex — OS boards made end-user legible

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`.
- discomfort: the lower MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, and GenesisOS panels had real
  evidence, but they still read like diagnostics. End users need to know what
  each OS means for the current work before they care about raw counts.
- result: added product-summary cards to each OS board. MemoryOS now leads
  with trusted memories, review debt, retrieval traces, graph edges, and
  `Ask Memory`/`Find Missing` actions. CapabilityOS now leads with tool cards,
  observations, known gaps, permission count, and `Route Task`/`Ask Permission`
  actions. GenesisOS now leads with worldlines, discomforts, needs, seeds, and
  `Feel Friction`/`Make Worlds` actions.
- action binding: these product-board actions now use `POST /api/ask` with
  `draft_contract=true`, so a deliberate click creates a governed ask receipt
  and contract seed rather than only preparing chat text.
- fix: added `id="genesis-lens"` so visual-focus verification can capture the
  GenesisOS board directly.
- verification:
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`;

  `.aios/asks/ask-45b63b455d6d-20260518T040154/contract_seed.md`.
- next: surface the newly created ask/contract seed in the first-screen
  Evidence Desk so clicks feel completed without opening hidden files.

## 2026-05-18 03:49 KST — codex — Control Center image-board v4 + OS loop mini-map

  `docs/design/AIOS_CONTROL_CENTER_REFERENCE_BOARD.md`, and
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`.
- trigger: founder allowed a full Control Center redesign and asked to generate
  an app image board first, then use it as the implementation reference.
- reference: generated and pinned
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-center-reference-board-v4.png`.
- discomfort: the first-screen Evidence Desk showed route rows and receipts,
  but it still lacked the immediately legible "operating system is alive"
  visual that the v4 board makes obvious.
- result: added a first-screen `Live AIOS operating loop` mini-map to
  the Evidence Desk. Hive Mind is centered, while MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  GenesisOS, and MyWorld render as orbit nodes with live status/detail text
  from the control snapshot.
- verification:
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot tests.test_aios_visual_verify -v`
  passed 58/58;

- evidence: visual verification receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-3bf6c463ca73/receipt.json` passed, with
  screenshot `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-center-v4-os-loop-polished.png`.
- next: continue the v4 board by turning the lower MemoryOS,
  CapabilityOS, and GenesisOS panels into end-user visual boards rather than
  operator-heavy diagnostic cards.

## 2026-05-18 01:58 KST — codex — Genesis advisory made actionable

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, and
  refreshed Control Center snapshot assets.
- discomfort: GenesisOS monitor findings already named prompt-prison contracts
  and escape vectors, but the Control Center collapsed them into a generic
  next-action line. The user could see that GenesisOS was unhappy, but not what
  to do with the discomfort.
- result: Friction Radar now preserves `genesis_prompt_prison_advisory`
  samples, contract paths, signatures, and escape vectors. It renders each
  flagged contract with artifact controls and a `Break Frame` chat action that
  asks AIOS to produce alternate worldlines, verification gates, and a contract
  seed. Persona-axis advisories now show weak persona scores and a
  `Route Persona Gap` action.
- verification:
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`;
  `python scripts/aios_local_app.py refresh --json`;
  Playwright operator-mode screenshot
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-friction-radar-actionable-final.png` confirmed
  `Break Frame`, `ASC-0192`, escape vectors, and `retriever_score` are visible.
- next: wire `Break Frame` output into a one-click proposed contract materializer
  so GenesisOS discomfort can move from critique to governed work without a
  manual prompt rewrite.

## 2026-05-18 01:45 KST — codex — Dispatch MemoryOS trace visibility

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, and
  refreshed Control Center snapshot assets.
- discomfort: ASC-0197 made MemoryOS retrieval evidence mandatory for
  memory-required dispatch, but the Control Center still showed dispatch rows
  as raw send/collect state. Users could not see whether a packet carried an
  actual `rtrace_...` and positive `signal_coverage`.
- result: snapshot loading now inspects matching `.aios/inbox/<repo>/<dispatch>`
  packets and archived `.aios/archive/inbox/<repo>/<dispatch>` packets, then
  exposes `session_envelope.memory_context` on dispatch rows. Evidence Desk
  prefers a live MemoryOS trace when present, adds a trace receipt row, and
  Latest Dispatches displays a compact MemoryOS trace chip.
- dogfood: created and sent
  `asc-0197-live-memory-visibility` with session envelope
  `.aios/invocations/inv-454672af7ad3-20260518T012019/session_envelope.json`.
  The packet was reconciled to archive because ASC-0197 is closed; this exposed
  an address-location fragility, so archive lookup was added. The watcher then
  verified the archived packet and wrote
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0197-live-memory-visibility.myworld.result.json`
  with `retrieval_trace: rtrace_b70da6ffc87b1f90` and
  `signal_coverage: 1.0`.
- fix: `aios_dispatch.py` now permits the safe verification command shape
  `git diff --check ...`; before this, ASC-0197 send crashed with an
  unstructured traceback on its own verification gate.
- verification:
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_dispatch.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;

  `python scripts/aios_visual_verify.py http://127.0.0.1:8765/ --screenshot .aios/screenshots/aios-control-memory-backed-dispatch.png --allow-degraded --json`.
- next: remove the stale `policy_dispatch_decision` churn for already-closed or
  invalid-repo contracts so the Intent Lens stops saying a collected packet is
  still blocked.

## 2026-05-18 01:39 KST — codex — Control Center image-board v3 redesign

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `docs/design/AIOS_CONTROL_CENTER_REFERENCE_BOARD.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and screenshot receipts.
- trigger: founder allowed a full visual redesign and asked for an app image
  board first.
- result: generated the v3 reference board at
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-center-reference-board-v3.png`, then
  reshaped the Control Center into a provider-grade chat-first cockpit:
  central AIOS conversation workbench, right evidence/OS route rail, compact
  intent lens, and mobile one-column fallback.
- verification:
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`;

  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-741b705910b2/receipt.json`; mobile receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-f5bd92feae4c/receipt.json`.
- next: continue the same visual direction by making dispatch/session-envelope
  MemoryOS trace evidence visible inside the first-screen Evidence Desk.

## 2026-05-17 21:12 KST — codex — UI/UX ownership clarified

- status: done
- scope: `docs/agents/CODEX_UI_AGENT.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`, and this worklog.
- trigger: founder reassigned Codex to focus on design, UI/UX, frontend, and
  visual verification instead of acting as the broad default implementation
  worker across child repos.
- result: added a Codex UI Agent role file and updated MyWorld guidance so
  Codex owns Control Center/chat/product surfaces, screenshot-first evidence,
  interface discomfort detection, and visual verification. Non-UI child-repo
  implementation should route through Hive Mind or the owning repo agent.
- transition note: ASC-0190 was already running through the child watcher when
  this focus changed. It completed successfully as `asc-0190-r2`; hivemind now
  has dirty repo-owned implementation changes pending owner review.
- next: continue Control Center visual work by making OS activity and evidence
  easier to inspect without raw logs as the primary surface.

## 2026-05-17 16:55 KST — codex — Screenshot-first chat design workflow

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `scripts/aios_local_app.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`, and this
  worklog.
- discomfort: the focused AIOS chat surface was technically connected, but the
  first viewport was dominated by conversation history, not the user/AIOS
  conversation. Provider responses also rendered Markdown as raw text, making
  the Gate feel like a receipt surface instead of a chatbot.
- reference: captured and inspected
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-reference-before.png` before patching. The
  bounded Firefox verifier also reproduced the known degraded path at
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-8025bfad43d3/receipt.json` with
  `browser_verification_timeout`.
- result: promoted the chat thread to the main viewport, moved conversation
  history into a right evidence rail, added a compact
  `Reference -> Build -> Verify` visual workflow strip, added safe minimal
  Markdown rendering for chat answers, and documented the screenshot-first app
  workflow in `docs/AIOS_BUILD_METHOD.md`.
- capability loop: completed the pending recommendation-only CapabilityOS
  fallback preview action for failed provider chat turns. `Preview` runs
  `capabilityos.cli provider-route` without writing an inbox packet; `Fallback`
  still requires confirmed packet creation.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py
  scripts/aios_visual_verify.py`; `node --check apps/control/chat.js` and
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot
  tests.test_aios_visual_verify -v` passed 44/44 before Markdown polish, and
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 36/36 after it.
  Playwright via the existing `uri/node_modules/playwright` substrate captured
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-design-workflow-after.png` and
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-design-workflow-markdown.png`.
- next: make the visual workflow dynamic by showing the latest reference and
  after screenshot receipts inside Control Center rather than static workflow
  chips.

## 2026-05-17 16:47 KST — codex — Chat history weakness cards create OS packets

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: Chat History could reveal `failed_provider` and
  `memory_review_needed` cards, but the user still had to manually translate
  that observation into a CapabilityOS or MemoryOS work packet. That made the
  UI diagnostic but not operational.
- result: added `POST /api/chat_history_action` with confirmation gating.
  `failed_provider` cards can now emit a recommendation-only CapabilityOS
  fallback review packet under `.aios/inbox/CapabilityOS/`; memory review gap
  cards reuse the existing MemoryOS draft review packet path under
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/`. The standalone chat history UI now adds `Fallback`
  and `Review` actions only on matching cards.
- evidence: unit fixtures verified that a failed provider history item writes
  a `CHAT-HISTORY-FALLBACK-REVIEW` packet with safe source artifacts and that a
  memory review gap creates a new MemoryOS review packet for the unresolved
  draft. Live API smoke returned `confirmation_required` for an unconfirmed
  action, proving the endpoint is active and fail-closed.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`
  passed 40/40; `git diff --check` passed for touched files.
- runtime: Control Center was restarted and is live on
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`; websocket is live on
  `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`. Round controller remains running with
  `latest_status=passed`.
- next: add a route-plan preview for CapabilityOS fallback packets so the UI
  can show the recommended provider/tool order before a watcher executes it.

## 2026-05-17 14:59 KST — codex — Chat Gate answer surface de-systemized

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`, and
  this worklog.
- discomfort: the standalone AIOS chat could route through MemoryOS,
  CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, and a Chair provider, but successful provider turns
  still appended the deterministic fallback after `---`. That made the front
  surface look like a system receipt even when a provider-backed answer existed.
- result: Korean Gate/architecture phrases such as `게이트`, `라우팅`, and
  `시스템 답변` now classify as `answer_architecture` instead of falling
  through to a generic cheap provider turn. Successful provider turns now return
  only the provider answer; runtime evidence stays in metadata/artifacts.
- evidence: live HTTP smoke for `AIOS에는 너처럼 routing 해주는 Gate Agent가
  있나, 아니면 시스템 답변밖에 못하나?` returned
  `chosen_substrate=aios_gate`, `route_reason=gate_answer`,
  `provider_turn=null`, and a natural Gate Chair answer without the old
  deterministic fallback suffix.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py`; `node --check apps/control/chat.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 35/35;
  `git diff --check` passed for touched files.
- runtime: Control Center is live on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, websocket is
  live on `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`, and the round controller remains
  running with `latest_status=passed`.
- next: bind failed-provider and memory-review history cards to explicit
  CapabilityOS fallback / MemoryOS evidence-review packets.

## 2026-05-17 14:18 KST — codex — ASC-0188 Gate Chair activation policy

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0188-gate-chair-conversational-activation-policy.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: AIOS had a Gate/Chair layer, but provider-like Chair candidates
  were blocked unless they strictly beat the deterministic internal baseline.
  That made the chat surface stay deterministic even when an external Chair
  matched baseline quality and could make the Gate feel more conversational.
- result: Gate Chair eval now marks an external candidate as
  `promotion_ready` only when it has no failed current Chair runs and
  `scores.current >= scores.internal`. Ties are explicitly framed as
  operator-confirmed conversational activation, not proof of better reasoning.
  Runtime disclosure checks now accept `Gate Chair runtime`,
  `chair_runtime.json`, and `chair_candidate_runtime.json` to avoid false
  negatives.
- evidence: live candidate matrix wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair_matrix/fe4408ac3749b4de/report.json`. Claude and
  Codex executed as external runtimes; Gemini produced access-denied failures.
  A later single Claude eval wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/0e5c3debdf207a41/report.json` with
  `current_failure_count=1` and `promotion_ready=false`, so the candidate was
  correctly not promoted. Its timeout draft entered MemoryOS review through
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-516592f120c5324c.memoryOS.result.json` with
  `review_decision=needs_more_evidence`,
  `memory_object_id=mem_0902250e1222787a`, and
  `review_id=review_1b6388ec35e0d3f5`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py
  scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval tests.test_aios_chat_router
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 72/72.
- next: keep the active Chair internal until a provider/local Chair matches or
  beats baseline with zero failures, then promote through the existing
  `Promote Chair` gate.

## 2026-05-17 14:08 KST — codex — ASC-0187 CapabilityOS visual route

- status: done
- scope: `CapabilityOS/capabilityos/catalog.py`,
  `CapabilityOS/tests/fixtures/capabilities.json`,
  `CapabilityOS/tests/test_cli.py`, `CapabilityOS/README.md`,
  `CapabilityOS/AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0187-capabilityos-browser-visual-verification-route.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: AIOS had a bounded visual verifier, but CapabilityOS still did
  not have a first-class browser visual verification route. UI screenshot work
  therefore ranked generic workflow capabilities ahead of a browser-specific
  plan, even after the Firefox timeout receipt made the gap concrete.
- result: added `cap_browser_visual_verification_route` as a recommendation-only
  card with browser/screenshot/fallback/timeout domains and evidence refs to
  the visual verifier receipt. UI/browser screenshot fallback tasks now rank it
  first while `audit` still reports `execution_enabled=[]`.
- next: add a route-plan surface for choosing among Firefox, Chromium,
  Playwright, and plugin agent-browser without CapabilityOS executing them.

## 2026-05-17 13:58 KST — codex — Bounded visual verification primitive

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_visual_verify.py`, `tests/test_aios_visual_verify.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: after the Chat-first Control Center change, Firefox headless
  screenshot did not produce a file and then hung when forced through a fresh
  profile. That left visual verification as a manual, brittle operator action.
- result: added a dependency-free visual verifier that checks page load first,
  attempts a headless screenshot with a hard timeout, kills the browser process
  group on timeout, and always writes an `aios.visual_verification.v1` receipt.
  Missing screenshot evidence now becomes a durable `degraded`/`failed`
  receipt with `browser_visual_evidence_missing` instead of a stuck loop.
- evidence: live Control Center verification loaded `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`
  with HTTP 200 and wrote degraded receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-2c99e07acb2a/receipt.json` after Firefox
  screenshot timed out. MemoryOS reviewed the negative evidence draft via
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-15c71f52178df865.memoryOS.result.json`
  (`review_decision=needs_more_evidence`, memory object
  `mem_2341bbb4ff8abcc7`). CapabilityOS recommendation evidence was saved to
  `.aios/capability_routes/visual-verification-firefox-timeout.json`.
- next: route UI contracts through this verifier and promote browser-specific
  failure receipts into CapabilityOS so the system can choose better visual
  tooling than a hanging Firefox path.

  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the Gate could answer conversationally, but the Control Center
  still opened like an operator console. A user had to pass runtime and goal
  surfaces before reaching the direct AIOS conversation, and the inline
  composer did not behave like the standalone chat.
- result: moved `Conversation / Talk to AIOS` to the first work surface, made
  `Simple` the default dashboard mode, hid operator-only bands in Simple mode,
  added an `Open Chat` jump to the focused chat page, and aligned inline input
  behavior with `chat.html` (`Enter` sends, `Shift+Enter` inserts newline,
  textarea height follows content).
- next: test the browser layout visually and tighten the Chat/Gate runtime
  promotion loop so a provider-grade Chair can replace deterministic fallback
  when it has evidence.

  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: active-runtime demotion protected chat from repeated provider
  failures, but without a recovery proof the system could become sticky:
  historical failures would keep blocking a provider even after the provider
  became healthy again.
- result: demotion now scans Gate Chair eval receipts in reverse time order. A
  newer eval with `promotion_ready=true`, matching runtime mode/model, no
  failed current runs, and `scores.current >= scores.internal` clears older
  failures for normal chat. The failure artifacts stay durable; only their
  routing effect is superseded by stronger recovery evidence. The Control
  Center Runtime band now exposes the recovery report ref and superseded
  failure count when this happens.
- next: use the same recovery proof in automatic candidate promotion
  explanations.

  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: AIOS could record Gate Chair provider failures, but an active
  external Chair runtime could still remain configured and keep getting called
  in normal chat. That makes the Gate look connected while the user experiences
  repeated timeout/access-denied fallback.
- result: normal chat now computes an effective Chair runtime. If the active
  provider/Ollama Chair accumulates repeated recent failure evidence from
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/*/report.json` or
  `.aios/chat/*/gate_chair_turns.jsonl`, `gate_chair_command` demotes the
  effective runtime to `internal_evidence_synthesizer` and the runtime summary
  discloses the demotion. The Control Center Runtime band now exposes
  `configured_mode`, `effective_mode`, and demotion count so users can see the
  shield without opening trace artifacts. Candidate eval overrides are not
  demoted while being tested.
- next: use recovery proof refs in the Runtime band when available.

- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: Gate Chair candidate evals can produce useful negative provider
  evidence, but `needs_more_evidence` MemoryOS drafts had no visible way to
  send newly attached evidence back through review. That made the memory loop
  feel append-only instead of iterative.
- result: ran a Gate Chair candidate matrix. The active runtime remains
  `internal_evidence_synthesizer`; `claude` and `codex` did not beat baseline,
  and `gemini` produced provider access-denied failures. The generated
  negative-evidence draft was sent through MemoryOS review and returned
  `needs_more_evidence` as `mem_4f920704f38df5be` /
  `review_afdb1431d98c42d8`. Control Center Memory Draft cards now show
  `Request Re-review` after supplemental evidence exists, and re-review packets
  preserve evidence receipt/artifact refs.
- evidence:
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair_matrix/bc01588d9e7e816d/report.json`,
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-0480198fc9ad3b51.memoryOS.result.json`.
- next: build automatic candidate demotion/rollback from failed Chair eval
  reports so provider-grade Gate runtime cannot stay active after repeated
  timeout/access-denied evidence.

  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: MemoryOS could say `needs_more_evidence`, and the UI could show
  that need, but the operator still had no immediate place to attach the
  corroborating note or artifact that would make the draft reviewable again.
- result: added `POST /api/memory_review_evidence` and an `Add Evidence`
  control on `needs_more_evidence` Memory Draft cards. Evidence records are
  append-only receipts under `.aios/memory_review_evidence/` and
  `.aios/state/memory_review_evidence.jsonl`; they do not accept memory or
  rerun MemoryOS review automatically.
- next: add a second-stage "request re-review with attached evidence" path so
  MemoryOS can reconsider drafts once enough evidence has accumulated.

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: after Control Center showed `needs_more_evidence`, the Chat Gate
  could still answer memory/friction turns as if only accepted context mattered.
  That hides weak-memory evidence from the next promotion attempt.
- result: chat now reads recent `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-*.result.json`
  receipts and projects `needs_more_evidence` review gaps into memory,
  friction, and action turns. Memory answers distinguish selected context from
  unaccepted drafts and explicitly say 보강 증거 is required before durable
  memory acceptance.
- next: turn repeated review-gap prompts into a small evidence collection
  command so the user can attach corroborating artifacts from chat.

- discomfort: MemoryOS correctly returned `needs_more_evidence` for a
  GenesisOS friction memory draft, but the Control Center only exposed the
  decision string. That makes failed/weak memory review feel like a dead end.
- result: Memory Draft cards now derive and display a next-evidence hint for
  `needs_more_evidence`, keeping the draft unaccepted while telling the user
  what would make it stronger: corroborating artifact, operator review note,
  or repeated future turns.
- next: feed repeated `needs_more_evidence` patterns back into Gate prompts so
  chat asks for missing evidence before trying to promote similar memories.

- discomfort: chat could promote a Genesis friction seed into
  `.aios/promotions/`, but the next operator step still required manual file
  copying into `docs/contracts/`, leaving the self-evolution loop visibly
  incomplete.
- result: wired `POST /api/materialize_promotion_contract` into the local app,
  added Control Center promotion queue controls for `ASC-NNNN` assignment, and
  taught the snapshot to surface materialized contract paths and receipts.
- next: keep the acceptance and dispatch gates separate; proposed contracts
  must still be reviewed before Hive execution.

  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: chat could now write `friction_contract_seed.md`, but the seed
  still required manual copying before it appeared in the reviewed promotion
  queue.
- result: added `POST /api/promote_friction_seed`. The endpoint accepts only
  `.aios/chat/*/friction_contract_seed.md`, requires confirmation, checks the
  speculative/not-execution guardrail text, copies the seed into
  `.aios/promotions/<id>/contract_seed.md`, and writes a promotion receipt with
  `execution_started=false`. Control Center and standalone chat Trace rows now
  expose `Promote Seed` after a reviewed-seed checkbox.
- next: treat promoted friction seeds as queue items for operator ASC
  assignment, acceptance, and dispatch; do not let GenesisOS bypass MyWorld
  acceptance.

- discomfort: GenesisOS could produce discomfort/need branches, but the result
  stayed as a chat answer plus memory draft. That made self-diagnosis visible
  but not operationally connected to the contract/Hive loop.
- result: when a user explicitly asks for friction/need or sends an
  action-like turn with GenesisOS friction available, AIOS chat now writes
  `.aios/chat/<conversation>/friction_contract_seed.md`. The seed is
  `status: proposed`, `authority: speculative_only`, contains evidence refs,
  and states that it is not execution authority until assigned and accepted as
  an ASC contract. Both Control Center chat surfaces expose the seed in the
  collapsed Trace.
- next: use these seeds as reviewable inputs for Ask/ASC promotion instead of
  letting self-diagnosis end as a one-off conversation.

## 2026-05-17 12:41 KST — codex — Gate current-info overhold fix

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: asking AIOS "지금 가장 불편한 점과 다음 필요성" was held as
  external current information because the Gate treated bare `지금` as a
  current-info trigger. That blocks self-diagnosis, which is the core AIOS
  coevolution loop.
- result: narrowed current-info detection to external factual domains such as
  weather, market prices, exchange rates, news, releases, and versions. Bare
  time words no longer block AIOS self-diagnosis or operating-state questions.
- evidence: added a regression test proving the self-diagnosis prompt does not
  route to `capability_route_required` or `require_current_info_route` while
  the weather hold test remains intact.
- next: continue using live self-diagnosis prompts to find over-holds,
  under-routes, and weak MemoryOS/GenesisOS use before promoting any provider
  Chair.

## 2026-05-17 12:38 KST — codex — Standalone AIOS chat HTTP fallback

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/chat.js`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the Control Center inline chat could fall back to `POST
  /api/chat`, but standalone `chat.html` required an open WebSocket before it
  would send a message. Over SSH/Tailscale, that makes the direct chat app feel
  broken even when the local HTTP API is healthy.
- result: added `sendViaHttp()` to `chat.js` and changed submit handling so a
  message uses WebSocket when open, otherwise posts to `/api/chat` and renders
  the same AIOS answer and trace.
- next: keep simplifying visible chat behavior while preserving route,
  MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, and Hive evidence in collapsed trace
  artifacts.

- discomfort: AIOS had a Gate Chair candidate matrix, but the end-user surface
  still only exposed a single `Eval Chair` button. The user could not see why
  AIOS chat still behaved like a system receipt without leaving the UI.
- result: extended `POST /api/gate_chair_eval` with `candidate_matrix=true`.
  The Control Center Runtime band now has `Compare Chairs`, which runs the
  matrix for Claude and Codex candidates without activation, requests MemoryOS
  review for failure evidence, shows baseline/candidate scores and failure
  counts, and opens the matrix report through the read-only artifact preview.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app
  tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval -v` passed 33/33; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js`; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py
  scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`.
- next: keep the active Chair deterministic until a candidate matrix report
  shows an external provider/local Chair that beats the baseline without failed
  runs. Then promote through the existing `Promote Chair` gate.

## 2026-05-17 12:29 KST — codex — Gate Chair candidate matrix

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_gate_chair_eval.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this
  worklog.
- discomfort: AIOS could evaluate one Chair candidate at a time, but deciding
  among Claude, Codex, local, and other provider Chairs still depended on
  manual sequential probes.
- result: added `--candidate-matrix` and repeatable `--candidate <mode>`. The
  matrix evaluates each provider as a temporary
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_candidate_runtime.json`, restores the prior
  candidate config, writes
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair_matrix/<matrix_id>/report.json`, and marks a
  candidate promotion-eligible only when it is external, has no failed Chair
  runs, and beats the deterministic baseline.
- evidence: live matrix for Claude and Codex wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair_matrix/89f295e621162a9b/report.json`.
  Baseline scored `1.0`; Claude scored `0.75` with one failure and wrote
  `.aios/chat/gate-chair-eval-ba61e152ab1dc0ea-failures/memory_drafts.json`;
  Codex scored `0.75` with no failed Chair run but did not beat baseline.
  Recommendation was `hold_all_candidates`. The Claude failure draft entered
  MemoryOS review via
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-2279ea45e005e5b5.memoryOS.json`; one-shot
  watcher processing wrote
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-2279ea45e005e5b5.memoryOS.result.json` with

  `review_decision=needs_more_evidence`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval -v`
  passed 6/6; live MemoryOS watcher processing succeeded.

  user sees candidate comparison instead of only single Chair eval.

  worklog.
- discomfort: Gate Chair eval could create a failure memory draft, but the
  operator/control loop still needed a separate step to send that draft into
  MemoryOS review.
- result: added `--request-memory-review`. When a failed eval creates a
  `negative_evidence_signal`, the eval can now also write the corresponding
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/*.memoryOS.json` review packet. The watcher remains the
  executor; the eval does not auto-accept memory.
- evidence: live Claude candidate eval with

  candidates and only promotes a runtime after repeated non-timeout evidence
  beats the deterministic baseline.

- discomfort: formal Gate Chair eval could detect timeout/backpressure, but
  those failures still needed a later user chat turn before entering the
  Memory Drafts queue.
- result: Gate Chair eval now writes a draft `negative_evidence_signal` at
  `.aios/chat/gate-chair-eval-<eval_id>-failures/memory_drafts.json` whenever
  a run fails or Chair status is non-success. The draft includes the eval
  report and Gate Chair turn refs so MemoryOS can review the evidence directly.

  MemoryOS can move repeated Chair failure evidence from `needs_more_evidence`
  toward accept/reject.

## 2026-05-17 12:16 KST — codex — Gate Chair chat failures become route evidence

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: AIOS learned from formal Gate Chair eval failures, but ordinary
  chat runtime failures in `.aios/chat/*/gate_chair_turns.jsonl` were not
  projected into the next routing decision. That let a provider Chair timeout
  remain visible in logs but weak in the live Gate.
- result: `local_negative_evidence()` now scans recent
  `gate_chair_turns.jsonl` rows, turns non-success Chair statuses such as
  `gate_chair_timeout` into local negative evidence, and writes
  `negative_evidence_signal` memory drafts when a chat turn uses that evidence.
  The evidence can guide routing immediately, but remains draft-only until
  MemoryOS review.
- evidence: live `provider 실패 기억은?` returned
  `negative_evidence_source=aios_receipts`, `negative_evidence_count=5`, and
  included chat-turn refs such as
  `.aios/chat/gate-chair-eval-4a0291d9e0c14724-current-1/gate_chair_turns.jsonl`
  alongside eval report refs. A second live turn wrote
  `.aios/chat/control-center/memory_drafts.json` with
  `extra_draft_ids=[..._genesis, ..._negative]` and a draft whose
  `origin=aios_chat_negative_evidence`.
- MemoryOS dogfood: sent the latest negative draft to MemoryOS via
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-2016d68bbb3ef828.memoryOS.json`; one-shot
  child watcher processing passed and wrote
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-2016d68bbb3ef828.memoryOS.result.json`.
  MemoryOS imported one draft memory object `mem_e14d99146a8a218e`, one
  review `review_55774caff6f21234`, one source artifact, and one hyperedge
  with `review_decision=needs_more_evidence` and `memory_status=draft`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed
  28/28; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py` passed.

  contract seeds read the envelope's context pack to carry

  containing `retrieval_trace`, `signal_coverage`, and
  `MemoryOS / Retriever`.
- Gate Chair observation: evaluating the existing Claude candidate with
  `AIOS_GATE_CHAIR_RUNTIME_PATH=.aios/gate/founder/chair_candidate_runtime.json`
  wrote `.aios/evals/gate_chair/4a0291d9e0c14724/report.json`; the candidate
  timed out (`gate_chair_timeout`) and is not promotion-ready, so active chat
  should remain on deterministic Chair until a candidate beats it.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_invoke
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 33/33; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_persona_audit tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 34/34; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_invoke.py
  scripts/aios_persona_audit.py scripts/aios_chat_router.py` passed.
- next: use this promotion seed path for the next AIOS self-development
  contract so MemoryOS usage is visible before operator acceptance.

## 2026-05-17 12:00 KST — codex — Genesis prompt-prison advisory cleanup

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0183-dream-parametric-per-repo-adapters.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0184-hooks-deterministic-enforcement.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0185-leased-jobs-queue.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the latest open contracts described important mechanisms but
  still read as AIOS-internal design language. GenesisOS flagged
  single-frame, assumption-silent, terminology-trapped, and time-frozen
  signatures.
- result: added advisory-only `GenesisOS Escape Review` sections naming
  assumptions, counter branches, plain-language restatements, cross-domain
  analogies, and 1h / 1 week / 1 year time horizons. Contract statuses and
  acceptance state were not changed.
- verification: `python scripts/aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py --limit 6
  --json` reported `flagged_count=0` across ASC-0180, ASC-0183, ASC-0184, and
  ASC-0185. `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` no longer reports
  `genesis_prompt_prison_advisory`.
- next: use this escape review shape in new AIOS contracts before acceptance,
  especially when the contract introduces new authority, training, hooks, or
  queue semantics.

## 2026-05-17 12:02 KST — codex — Persona-axis advisory made actionable

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_persona_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_persona_audit.py`, `docs/AIOS_PERSONA_AXIS.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_SMART_CONTRACT.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, and this
  worklog.
- discomfort: the monitor's `persona_axis_advisory` reported a low composite
  but did not tell the next AIOS contract what to change. That makes the
  five-persona frame feel like another dashboard number rather than an
  operating habit.
- result: persona audit reports `weak_personas` and `contract_gaps` with
  concrete recommendations. The contract docs now require AIOS
  self-development seeds to name Hive/Wrapper, MemoryOS/Retriever,
  CapabilityOS/Router, GenesisOS/Philosophy, and MyWorld/Sovereign evidence or
  explicitly justify absence.
- boundary: did not rewrite closed contracts to inflate historical scores.
  The audit remains advisory and preserves the record of earlier worker-mode
  drift.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_persona_audit -v` passed
  3/3; `python scripts/aios_persona_audit.py --window 20 --json
  --assert-keys weak_personas,contract_gaps,persona_composite` returned the
  new fields; combined chat/control/router regression suite passed 57/57.
- next: future contract generation should populate the 5-persona note from
  actual MemoryOS traces, CapabilityOS recommendations, GenesisOS critic
  branches, and Hive provider/fallback evidence before acceptance.

## 2026-05-17 11:56 KST — codex — Chat-first AIOS conversation surface

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the backend now returns conversational answers, but the web
  surface still exposed provider substrate and Chair runtime labels directly
  under the assistant bubble. That made AIOS feel like a system receipt viewer
  instead of a chat front door.
- result: moved route, substrate, MemoryOS trace, and Gate Chair runtime
  metadata into collapsed `Trace` evidence for both the Control Center inline
  chat and standalone `chat.html`; hid the inline conversation id field; kept
  artifact previews and provenance available on demand.
- boundary: no Chair runtime was promoted and no provider credentials or PINs
  were changed. The active Chair remains the deterministic
  `internal_evidence_synthesizer` until a non-internal candidate passes eval.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js && node --check
  apps/control/chat.js`; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 30/30; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 27/27; `git diff --check` passed for
  the touched files. Live `/api/chat` for `나에 대한 기억은 ?` returned a
  MemoryOS content answer while keeping `ollama_qwen` and
  `internal_evidence_synthesizer` as metadata. Playwright screenshots:
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-first-inline.png` and
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-first-standalone.png`.
- next: evaluate a provider-grade or local LLM Gate Chair candidate again after
  timeout/backpressure is resolved, then promote only if the report marks
  `promotion_ready=true`.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Gate Chair defaults to active gate pack

- status: done
- trigger: Control Center chat could answer through deterministic Gate logic,
  but the provider-backed Gate Chair remained opt-in, so installed AIOS could
  still feel like a routing receipt instead of a conversational agent.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- result: when an active `.aios/gate/founder/gate_pack.json` exists, memory,
  identity, failure-evidence, status, Genesis, and provider-architecture
  answers may automatically run through the Gate Chair if a local Chair command
  or `ollama` is available. `AIOS_GATE_CHAIR_ENABLED=0` remains a hard disable.
  Chat API results now include `gate_chair_status`, and both chat UIs show the
  Chair status in message metadata/evidence. If no `AIOS_GATE_AGENT_COMMAND` or
  Ollama runtime exists, the Chair now succeeds through
  `mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer` rather than returning
  `command_unavailable`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 20/20;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 40/40; `node --check
  apps/control/chat.js && node --check apps/control/app.js` passed. Live
  `/api/chat` smoke for `나에 대한 기억은 ?` returned
  `gate_chair_status.status=success`,
  `mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`, and `executed=true`, proving installed
  AIOS can close a Chair turn without an external model runtime.
- decision: current-info/weather questions remain held by deterministic Gate
  routing and are not synthesized by the Chair without a source-aware
  CapabilityOS route.
- next: configure an actual local Chair runtime (`ollama` model or
  `AIOS_GATE_AGENT_COMMAND`) on the always-on AIOS install to improve natural
  language quality beyond deterministic evidence synthesis.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Gate Chair runtime visible in Control Center

- status: done
- trigger: after Gate Chair fallback became reliable, the Control Center still
  did not show which Chair runtime was active.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this
  worklog.
- result: control snapshots now include `installation.gate_chair` with
  `enabled`, `state`, `mode`, `detail`, `gate_pack_id`, and latest
  `gate_chair_turn` status. The Runtime band shows a Gate Chair card alongside
  command/service/control/loop.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed
  3/3; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py` passed;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed. Live snapshot refresh wrote
  `apps/control/aios-control-snapshot.json` and `apps/control/aios-control-data.js`
  with `gate_chair.state=internal`, `mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`, and
  latest Chair turn `status=success`.
- next: add an operator-facing action to configure or test an external local
  Chair runtime from the Control Center without editing shell env manually.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Gate Chair probe action

- status: done
- trigger: the Runtime band showed Gate Chair state but did not let the user
  test the current Chair path from the UI.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this
  worklog.
- result: added `POST /api/gate_chair_probe` and a `Test Gate Chair` button.
  The probe runs a bounded chat turn through `scripts/aios_chat.py`, returns
  `aios.gate_chair_probe.v1`, and reports `gate_chair_status` plus the
  `gate_chair_turn` artifact path without writing credentials or changing
  provider config.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 17/17;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` passed. After restarting the Control Center with
  `python scripts/aios_local_app.py up --json`, live
  `POST /api/gate_chair_probe` returned `ok=true`,
  `schema_version=aios.gate_chair_probe.v1`,
  `gate_chair_status.status=success`, and
  `mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`.
- next: add a quality comparison loop for `internal_evidence_synthesizer` vs an
  external local Chair runtime once one is installed.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Memory draft review now invokes MemoryOS importer

- status: done
- trigger: the prior watcher adapter closed the outbox result but only said
  `queued_for_memoryos_review`; MemoryOS had no automatic draft/review import
  from the packet.
- changed: `memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`, `memoryOS/tests/test_drafts_cli.py`,
  `memoryOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, and
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`.
- result: MemoryOS now exposes
  `memoryos drafts import-review-request <packet> --json`, which imports an
  `aios.memory_draft_review_request.v1` packet as a draft `MemoryObject`, a
  provenance `SourceArtifact`, a `derives_from` hyperedge, and an idempotent
  `ReviewRecord(action=needs_more_evidence, new_status=draft)`. The myworld
  child watcher now calls that CLI for future memory draft review packets and
  records returned `memory_object_id`, `source_artifact_id`, and `review_id`.
- evidence: in `memoryOS`, `python -m pytest tests/test_drafts_cli.py
  tests/test_doctor.py -q` passed 69/69 and `python -m py_compile
  memoryos/cli.py` passed. In `myworld`, `bash -n
  scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed and `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_child_watcher -v` passed 14/14. Live packet
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-08c98cd9e3ad7444.memoryOS.json` was imported by
  MemoryOS as `mem_6cb9a445afaa3f63`, `src_033818beffbb096e`, and
  `review_76432882a842e53e` with `auto_accept=false`.
- cleanup: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo memoryOS` closed the
  legacy non-dispatch-compatible packet
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-72432efe704fbde6.memoryOS.json` as `held` with
  `dispatch_id_missing` and `memory_mutated=false`, leaving memoryOS pending=0.
- decision: this still does not accept memory. It creates a MemoryOS-owned
  reviewable draft and audit row so operator review can happen later.
- risk: the already-written outbox result for `mdrev-08c98cd9e3ad7444` still
  reflects the earlier placeholder adapter result; future packets will include
  the real MemoryOS IDs directly.
- next: wire the Control Center memory draft card to display MemoryOS import
  IDs when present and add an operator review path for approve/reject/needs
  more evidence.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Memory draft review packet closes through watcher result

- status: done
- trigger: Memory Drafts could request review, but the generated
  `aios.memory_draft_review_request.v1` packet used a specialized
  `memoryOS-reviewer` agent that the child watcher did not understand.
- changed: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`,
  `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: the child watcher now consumes memory draft review request packets
  through a deterministic adapter, writes an `aios.dispatch.result.v1` outbox
  result without invoking provider CLIs, and preserves `auto_accept=false`.
  Control snapshots join review request receipts and outbox results back into
  `memory_draft_queue`, so the UI disables already queued drafts and exposes
  the review result artifact.
- evidence: `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot
  tests.test_aios_child_watcher tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 32/32;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js`
  passed. Live `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo memoryOS` processed
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-08c98cd9e3ad7444.memoryOS.json` and wrote
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/mdrev-08c98cd9e3ad7444.memoryOS.result.json` with
  `review_decision=queued_for_memoryos_review`; refreshed Control Center data
  shows `review_state=review_result_ready`.
- decision: adapter result is not MemoryOS acceptance. It is a closed
  control-plane handoff receipt; actual memory object import/review mutation
  remains MemoryOS-owned follow-up work.
- risk: MemoryOS still needs an idempotent importer for these chat draft
  candidates before they become real MemoryObject drafts.
- next: implement or dispatch the MemoryOS-owned importer/review decision path
  so `queued_for_memoryos_review` becomes accept/reject/needs_more_evidence on
  a MemoryObject with provenance.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Starting MemoryOS draft review packet action

- status: done
- trigger: the Control Center now shows chat/Genesis memory drafts, but there
  is no operator action that hands one candidate to the MemoryOS-owned review
  lifecycle.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- result: Control Center memory draft cards now have a `Request Review` action.
  The API validates `.aios/chat/<conversation>/memory_drafts.json`, selects a
  specific draft, writes `.aios/memory_draft_reviews/<id>/request.json`, appends
  `.aios/state/memory_draft_reviews.jsonl`, and writes a dispatch-compatible
  MemoryOS inbox packet at `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/<id>.memoryOS.json`.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py
  scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py` passed; `node --check apps/control/app.js`
  passed; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 16/16;
  earlier focused suite `tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot
  tests.test_aios_chat tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 40/40 before the
  dispatch-compatible field patch, and the changed local-app tests passed after
  the patch. Live `/api/memory_draft_review` smoke produced
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/mdrev-08c98cd9e3ad7444.memoryOS.json` with
  `dispatch_id`, `contract_path`, `return_to`, and `auto_accept=false`.
- decision: the Control Center will write a review request packet to
  `.aios/inbox/memoryOS/`; it will not approve, reject, or mutate MemoryOS
  memory objects directly.
- risk: duplicate review requests are possible until MemoryOS owns
  idempotency; packet provenance must keep source artifact refs and avoid raw
  private exports.
- next: make MemoryOS or the child watcher consume
  `aios.memory_draft_review_request.v1` packets and return a review result
  packet, then reflect pending/reviewed state in the Control Center queue.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Starting chat memory draft review queue

- status: done
- trigger: GenesisOS friction now enters `memory_drafts.json`, but the control
  UI does not yet show those draft-first MemoryOS candidates for operator
  review.
- changed: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- result: the Control Center snapshot now scans `.aios/chat/*/memory_drafts.json`
  and exposes `memory_draft_queue` with draft type counts, provenance refs,
  source artifact refs, and `operator_review_required` state. The web Control
  Center renders a Memory Drafts queue so `genesis_friction_signal` and chat
  summary drafts are visible before MemoryOS review.
- evidence: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check apps/control/app.js` and
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_control_snapshot tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 38/38; live snapshot data contains
  `.aios/chat/live-friction-draft-smoke/memory_drafts.json` and
  `genesis_friction_signal`; HTTP smoke confirmed the Control Center serves the
  Memory Drafts section and updated snapshot data.
- decision: keep this myworld-owned by scanning local `.aios/chat/**`
  artifacts; do not modify MemoryOS internals for this slice.
- risk: stale or private chat draft content must stay provenance-bound and
  draft-only; no auto-accept path will be added.
- next: add an explicit accept/reject/promote action for these draft candidates
  through a MemoryOS-owned review contract, rather than mutating MemoryOS from
  the Control Center directly.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Genesis friction becomes MemoryOS draft candidate

- status: done
- trigger: GenesisOS could answer friction questions, but the discomfort/need
  signal only lived in chat text and branch artifacts; it did not enter the
  draft-first MemoryOS review path.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: chat turns with `genesis_friction` now append an additional
  `genesis_friction_signal` item to `memory_drafts.json`, with provenance back
  to the Genesis branch artifact. The main `chat_turn_summary` draft is
  preserved, and the response payload reports `extra_draft_ids`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 35/35. Live `/api/chat` smoke for
  "이 대화에서 불편함과 숨은 필요성을 찾아줘" returned
  `memory_draft.extra_draft_ids` and wrote `genesis_friction_signal` into
  `.aios/chat/live-friction-draft-smoke/memory_drafts.json`.
- next: verify focused chat tests and live `/api/chat`; then wire a review
  affordance so these drafts can be promoted or rejected from the UI.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Genesis friction quick question added

- status: done
- trigger: GenesisOS friction was visible in evidence rows, but users still
  needed to know what to ask; "find discomfort/need" was not a first-class chat
  question.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `apps/control/chat.html`,
  `apps/control/index.html`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: AIOS Chat now recognizes friction/hidden-need/Genesis questions,
  answers them directly from `genesis_friction` without provider execution, and
  exposes `Find Friction` quick actions in standalone chat and the Control
  Center conversation panel.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 35/35. Live smoke through
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/chat` returned `provider_turn=null`,
  `genesis_friction`, and a direct GenesisOS discomfort/need answer; live
  `chat.html` and `index.html` include the new quick action buttons.
- next: verify the router, web static checks, and live `/api/chat` path; then
  use the friction answer as a promotion seed for the next UI/agent loop.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Genesis friction visible in web chat evidence

- status: done
- trigger: Chat Gate projected `genesis_friction` into JSON, but the web chat
  evidence block still only surfaced MemoryOS, provider, and artifact rows.
- changed: `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: Standalone chat and Control Center inline chat now render
  `genesis:<branch_id>` evidence rows with the discomfort -> need pair before
  provider/artifact receipts. This makes GenesisOS visible to end users as a
  first-class reasoning signal instead of a hidden branch artifact.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js` and `node --check
  apps/control/chat.js` passed; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`
  passed; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 34/34.
- next: run UI syntax checks and chat/local app tests, then refresh the local
  control app snapshot if needed.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - GenesisOS friction projected into Chat Gate

- status: done
- trigger: GenesisOS branches were already created for chat invocations, but
  the Gate did not read them, so discomfort/need stayed in artifacts instead of
  shaping conversation or action promotion.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: Chat now loads the invocation GenesisOS branch artifact, projects the
  first speculative discomfort/need pairs into
  `gate_decision.genesis_friction`, includes a `genesis_summary` in
  `operating_receipt`, exposes `genesis_branches` as an artifact path, and
  surfaces the first discomfort/need pair in action-like answers before Hive
  promotion. Gate Chair prompts receive the same Genesis context. Korean action
  turns containing provider/tool words now keep execution intent and route to
  Hive instead of being stolen by architecture-answer classification.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 34/34. Live smoke
  `python scripts/aios_chat.py --conversation genesis-friction-smoke
  --message 'AIOS web chat을 더 provider급으로 개선하는 작업 진행해' --json`
  wrote `genesis_friction` into the Gate decision and
  `operating_receipt.genesis_summary`; after intent refinement,
  `genesis-friction-smoke-2` routed the same action request to `hive_flow`.
- next: run focused chat tests and a live action-turn smoke, then decide
  whether Genesis friction should become a first-class quick action in the web
  chat UI.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Optional Gate Chair synthesis layer added

- status: done
- trigger: AIOS Chat had a Gate decision layer, but held answers still came
  from deterministic router text rather than a provider-backed Chair that can
  synthesize MemoryOS/CapabilityOS evidence into a natural answer.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: held Gate answers can now use an explicit Chair provider through
  `AIOS_GATE_AGENT_COMMAND`, or local/Ollama when `AIOS_GATE_CHAIR_ENABLED=1`.
  The Chair prompt receives only the current Gate decision, deterministic
  fallback answer, selected MemoryOS items, and negative evidence. Chair turns
  are recorded in `.aios/chat/<conversation>/gate_chair_turns.jsonl` and are
  shown in web evidence blocks. Codex/Claude fallback is not used by default.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 32/32, including an
  `AIOS_GATE_AGENT_COMMAND` fixture that rewrites a MemoryOS answer and records
  a `gate_chair_turns` artifact. Live smoke
  `AIOS_GATE_AGENT_COMMAND="printf 'Gate Chair: MemoryOS context was
  synthesized for the founder.'" python scripts/aios_chat.py --conversation
  gate-chair-smoke --message '나에 대한 기억은 ?' --json` returned the Chair
  answer and wrote `.aios/chat/gate-chair-smoke/gate_chair_turns.jsonl`.
- next: dogfood the Chair with a real local model or explicitly configured
  command, then use the transcripts to improve Gate examples through the sleep
  consolidation loop.
- follow-up: `python scripts/aios_gate_sleep.py --json` passed after the smoke
  and produced `gatepack_3e4a537ceb2b1516` with `source_pair_count=32` at
  `.aios/gate/founder/gate_pack.json`; a subsequent `너는 누구니` smoke
  projected that new pack into `gate_decision.gate_pack`.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Negative evidence now demotes bad provider candidates

- status: done
- trigger: MemoryOS failure evidence was visible in chat, but CapabilityOS
  provider/tool recommendations could still pick the same bad candidate on the
  next turn.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: Gate substrate selection now reads MemoryOS `negative_evidence`,
  maps bad-tool/provider memories to provider aliases, skips penalized
  CapabilityOS candidates when another candidate exists, and records
  `gate_decision.capability_route_audit` with skipped candidates and evidence
  IDs. This makes failure memories route-shaping evidence, not just prose.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed 13/13,
  including a fixture where CapabilityOS recommends local/ollama first and
  MemoryOS bad-tool evidence demotes it to Claude.
- next: expand the Gate from rules plus receipts into a provider-backed Chair
  response layer that can synthesize MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, and
  Hive outputs without exposing raw system logs to end users.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Chat response separated from operating receipt

- status: done
- trigger: AIOS Chat looked like a system receipt instead of a conversation
  because route, MemoryOS, session, and next-step diagnostics were appended to
  the assistant message body.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: `response` now contains the user-facing answer only. The old
  route/memory/session/next-step diagnostics are returned as
  `operating_receipt` and remain available through JSON/evidence artifacts.
  Memory questions such as `나에 대한 기억은?` now read like a direct answer
  while preserving trace metadata separately.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat tests.test_aios_local_app
  -v` passed 30/30; live smoke with `나에 대한 기억은 ?` returned selected
  MemoryOS memories in `response` and route diagnostics in
  `operating_receipt`.
- next: route negative MemoryOS evidence into CapabilityOS/provider selection
  so bad tools and blocked providers are avoided, not only explained.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - MemoryOS negative evidence surfaced in Gate

- status: done
- trigger: ASC-0174 made negative evidence a phase-1 requirement, but AIOS Chat
  still treated failure memories as generic selected memories.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: MemoryOS context now projects `negative_evidence`,
  `negative_evidence_count`, and `negative_evidence_source`;
  failure/blocker questions answer from those memories before provider
  execution; if MemoryOS selects no accepted failure memory, the Gate falls
  back to recent `.aios/outbox`, provider-attempt, and watcher receipts as
  `aios_receipts` route evidence. Web evidence blocks show `negative:<id>`
  rows before ordinary memory rows.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 30/30; live smoke
  `python scripts/aios_chat.py --conversation control-center-negative-smoke-2
  --message 'provider 실패 기억과 막힌 route를 알려줘' --json` returned
  `negative_evidence_source=aios_receipts` with 5 local failure receipts.
- monitor: `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reports
  `health=attention`, with remaining child-repo dirty and advisory findings;
  local app and websocket remain running.
- next: continue into CapabilityOS bad-tool routing so negative evidence can
  change provider/tool choice instead of only explaining failures.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Authority labels added to artifact evidence

- status: done
- trigger: ASC-0174 concluded that AIOS should show authority-routed system
  calls, not just raw logs and artifact paths.
- changed: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: Control Center and chat evidence artifacts now display compact
  labels such as `ingest · AIOS invocation record`, `promote · MyWorld
  contract`, and `observe · Control UI schema`.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/chat.js` passed; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 18/18; `python
  scripts/aios_local_app.py status --json` confirmed the local app and
  websocket are running with monitor `attention`.
- next: make MemoryOS negative evidence visible and retrievable so the Gate can
  learn from failed provider/tool routes, not only successful receipts.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - ASC-0174 debate released

- status: done
- trigger: monitor was blocked by ASC-0174 pending result packets after the
  observer-vs-executor reframe contract was accepted.
- changed: `hivemind/.runs/observer_vs_executor_debate/**`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/discoveries/2026-05-15-hive-observer-vs-executor-debate-result.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_MONITOR_RECONCILIATIONS.json`, and worklog.
- result: Hive deliberation now has 6 rounds, 18 voice artifacts, per-round
  syntheses, and a final verdict
  `proceed_authority_routed_management_plane`; MyWorld discovery summary
  records the system-call/authority-axis interpretation.
- verification: Hive voice verifier passed with 18 voice files and minimum
  word count 741; `aios_dispatch.py watch --repo hivemind --dispatch-id
  asc-0174 --once` passed; `aios_dispatch.py watch --repo myworld
  --dispatch-id asc-0174 --once` passed; result packets were collected and the
  dispatch was released with delegated authority override.
- monitor: `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` now reports
  `health=attention` instead of `blocked`; remaining alerts are child-repo
  dirty triage plus Genesis/persona advisories.
- next: implement the first downstream obligation from the verdict:
  authority/system-call labels in the Control UI, then MemoryOS negative
  evidence and CapabilityOS bad-tool routing.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Artifact URL restore added

- status: done
- trigger: evidence previews were inspectable, but reviewers could not return
  to the exact opened artifact without rerunning the chat/session context.
- changed: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- result: opening an allowed artifact now writes `#artifact=<path>` to the
  local URL; Control Center and chat restore that artifact in a fixed
  read-only preview drawer on load or hash change, and clear the drawer when
  the artifact hash is removed.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/chat.js` passed; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py
  scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_chat.py` passed; `python -m
  unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 28/28; `python
  scripts/aios_local_app.py status --json` confirmed the local server and
  websocket are running.
- next: monitor health is still `blocked`; inspect the active monitor blocker
  and turn it into the next concrete AIOS loop repair.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Artifact preview JSON/copy controls added

- status: done
- trigger: artifact previews were readable, but JSON showed as raw text and
  users still lacked one-click copy for artifact paths or loaded preview
  content.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and worklog.
- result: `/api/artifact` now classifies small `.json` previews as structured
  JSON, while Control Center and chat artifact preview controls include `Copy
  path` and `Copy preview` actions.
- bug_found_by_smoke: allowed-prefix matching initially rejected
  `apps/control/...` despite docs saying it was allowed; fixed by checking the
  normalized relative path against full allowed prefixes.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js` and `node --check apps/control/chat.js`
  passed; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_chat
  -v` passed 18/18; local app restarted and HTTP smoke confirmed JSON preview
  for `.aios/chat/http-json-smoke/cost.json` and `.env` rejection.
- next: add URL hash state for the currently opened artifact so a review can be
  shared and restored without rerunning the chat/session.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Artifact open primitive reused across Control Center

- status: done
- trigger: chat evidence had `Open` actions, but session role cards, promotion
  rows, the Agent Work artifact lane, and Hive board artifacts still required
  manual path copying.
- changed: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and worklog.
- result: session artifacts, promotion artifacts, Agent Work artifacts, Hive
  pipeline rows, and Hive artifact rows now reuse the same read-only
  `/api/artifact` preview primitive as chat evidence.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat
  tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 28/28; live HTTP smoke confirmed
  `/app.js` and `/styles.css` serve the artifact-open UI; local app remains
  running at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` with websocket running.
- next: add JSON folding/copy controls to artifact previews and expose the
  selected artifact path in the URL hash for shareable review state.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - Chat evidence artifact open action added

- status: done
- trigger: after evidence moved into expandable chat UI blocks, paths were
  still plain text and required the user to manually copy/open artifacts.
- changed: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, and
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`.
- result: Control Center exposes a read-only `/api/artifact` preview endpoint
  for allowed relative control-plane artifacts; dedicated chat and inline chat
  evidence rows now show `Open` actions for previewable paths.
- boundary: `/api/artifact` rejects traversal, absolute refs, `.env`, secrets,
  credentials, tokens, PINs, raw exports, and private history markers.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py` passed;
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js` and `node --check apps/control/app.js`
  passed; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_chat -v`
  passed 18/18; local app was restarted and HTTP smoke confirmed
  `/api/artifact` previews `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md` while rejecting blocked refs.
- next: make the evidence preview support JSON folding and copy actions, then
  use the same artifact-open primitive in session and Hive artifact lanes.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - AIOS Chat evidence UI separated

- status: done
- trigger: after MemoryOS memory answers became concrete, the web chat still
  risked mixing system evidence, memory IDs, provider-turn receipts, and
  artifact paths into the main answer surface.
- changed: `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_chat.py`, and
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`.
- result: dedicated chat and inline Control Center chat now render MemoryOS
  selected memories, provider-turn receipts, and artifact paths inside compact
  expandable evidence blocks while leaving the main answer readable.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/chat.js` passed; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js` passed; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router
  tests.test_aios_chat tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 26/26; local app
  status showed server and websocket running on ports 8765/8766; HTTP smoke
  confirmed served `/chat.js` and `/styles.css` include the evidence UI.
- next: convert chat evidence items into clickable artifact open actions in the
  Control Center instead of plain text paths.

## 2026-05-15 KST - codex - AIOS Chat memory/provider answer path hardened

- status: done
- trigger: founder observed that Control Center chat returned system/routing
  receipts for "나에 대한 기억은?" instead of an actual AIOS answer using
  MemoryOS content.
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  and `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`.
- result: chat turns now preserve `selected_memories` from MemoryOS context
  builds; memory questions surface memory content, IDs, and provenance hints
  directly in the answer; provider execution is attempted only after Gate
  routing and writes `provider_turns.jsonl` when used.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_chat tests.test_aios_local_app -v`
  passed 26/26; smoke `python scripts/aios_chat_router.py --conversation
  control-center-memory-smoke-2 --message '나에 대한 기억은?' --json` returned
  founder-intent memories before generic closeout receipts.
- next: wire the web chat UI to show memory IDs and provider-turn receipts as
  compact expandable evidence instead of mixing them into the main answer text.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0164 GenesisOS child watcher surface started

- status: active
- trigger: ASC-0163 next work requires dispatching GenesisOS implementation
  packets, but inspection showed `aios_dispatch.py` supports `GenesisOS` while
  `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` and `scripts/aios_monitor.py` still omit it
  from watcher/monitor repo loops.
- scope: myworld control-plane watcher/monitor support only.
- codex_ownership: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`,
  `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0164-genesisos-child-watcher-surface.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, ledger, and worklog.
- deferred: no GenesisOS source implementation and no child repo code changes
  under this contract.
- founder_signal_deferred_to_next_contract: GenesisOS is the OS that feels
  discomfort; creative inventions come from discomfort becoming named need and
  testable recombination candidate.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0164 GenesisOS child watcher surface closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `scripts/aios_monitor.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`, `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0164-genesisos-child-watcher-surface.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and worklog/ledger.
- result: GenesisOS is now part of the child watcher repo map, all-repo
  start/stop/status loops, focused watcher execution tests, and monitor repo
  snapshots. Generated Python cache entries are downgraded to low-signal
  generated-cache alerts instead of repo-dirty blockers.
- verification: `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_monitor.py` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py tests/test_aios_monitor.py`
  passed 24/24; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0164.myworld.result.json` passed; monitor
  returned `health=watch`, `watched.repos=4`, and one low
  `generated_cache_present` alert after collection.
- founder_signal_preserved: GenesisOS is the OS that feels discomfort; the
  next GenesisOS implementation contract should turn discomfort into named
  need, invention candidate, and recombination evidence.
- reverse_engineering_signal: Hive and CapabilityOS already cover execution
  and routing reasonably well; MemoryOS and GenesisOS remain weaker surfaces,
  which means strengthening retrieval, failure memory, discomfort sensing, and
  invention candidates is the best way to exploit provider blind spots.
- next: issue a GenesisOS child-repo contract for a discomfort-to-invention
  primitive now that the watcher can actually wake and monitor GenesisOS.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0165 MemoryOS/GenesisOS blindspot reinforcement started

- status: active
- trigger: founder observed that Hive and CapabilityOS are already relatively
  strong at provider execution/routing, while MemoryOS and GenesisOS remain
  weak. Reverse-engineering provider blind spots should therefore reinforce
  failure memory, retrieval of blind spots, discomfort sensing, and invention
  candidates.
- scope: MyWorld contract/dispatch plus bounded child-repo packets for
  GenesisOS and memoryOS.
- codex_ownership: `docs/contracts/ASC-0165-memory-genesis-provider-blindspot-reinforcement.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, dispatch packets, result collection, ledger, and
  worklog.
- child_ownership: GenesisOS owns the discomfort-to-invention primitive;
  MemoryOS owns draft-first failure-memory representation and retrieval
  guidance.
- deferred: no Hive Mind or CapabilityOS source edits in this contract.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0165 MemoryOS/GenesisOS blindspot reinforcement closed

- status: done
- changed: `GenesisOS/genesisos/cli.py`, `GenesisOS/tests/test_cli.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0165-memory-genesis-provider-blindspot-reinforcement.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and ledger.
- result: GenesisOS now has a `genesisos.discomfort.v1` CLI surface that turns
  friction into a speculative invention candidate; MemoryOS now has a
  draft-first `make_failure_memory_object()` helper and `import-run` preserves
  `kind=failure_memory` drafts as provenance-bound negative evidence.
- provider_evidence: child watcher attempts were held before operator rescue:
  GenesisOS saw Codex `provider_access_denied`, Claude
  `provider_backpressure`, and local final without verifier; memoryOS saw
  Codex `provider_access_denied` and local final without verifier.
- verification: GenesisOS `python -m unittest tests/test_critic.py tests/test_cli.py`
  passed 8/8; GenesisOS discomfort CLI emitted
  `schema_version=genesisos.discomfort.v1` and `authority=speculative_only`;
  memoryOS `python -m unittest tests/test_schema.py tests/test_import_run.py`
  passed 64/64; py_compile passed for edited GenesisOS and memoryOS modules.
- release: dispatch `asc-0165` released with explicit founder-delegated
  override and wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_a77bb22cadf11cae`.
- monitor: `health=attention`, with expected child repo dirty alerts for the
  ASC-0165 implementation and low generated-cache alert in GenesisOS.
- next: create a provider credential broker contract that never stores PINs in
  repo docs, packets, logs, code, or `.env`, and lets unattended watchers
  distinguish credential-required from provider failure.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0166 provider PIN-required classification started

- status: active
- trigger: founder asked whether Codex/Claude PINs can be stored in `.env` or
  should be removed. AIOS policy says not to store provider PINs in repo docs,
  packets, logs, code, or `.env`.
- scope: classify PIN-required provider failures without storing secrets.
- codex_ownership: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`,
  `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`, `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_pingpong.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0166-provider-pin-required-classification.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, ledger, and worklog.
- deferred: real credential broker/OS keyring integration remains a follow-up;
  this contract only fixes failure taxonomy and fallback eligibility.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0166 provider PIN-required classification closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`,
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`, `tests/test_aios_pingpong.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0166-provider-pin-required-classification.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, worklog, and ledger.
- result: localized PIN-attempt logs such as `틀렸습니다.` now classify as
  `pin_required_noninteractive`; generic Korean `접근 거부.` remains
  `provider_access_denied`; both child watcher and pingpong loops can fallback
  from the PIN-required category.
- environment_change: `/home/user/bin/codex` was changed to directly execute
  `/home/user/.nvm/versions/node/v22.22.2/bin/codex`, bypassing the prior
  local PIN-gate loader. The hidden loader config was not printed, copied, or
  stored.
- privacy: no PIN, credential, `.env`, provider auth file, raw private export,
  or private transcript was written.
- verification: `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed;
  `bash -n scripts/aios_pingpong.sh` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py tests/test_aios_pingpong.py`
  passed 15/15; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0166.myworld.result.json` passed; `codex --help`
  and a minimal `codex exec` smoke test returned without PIN denial.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_9ebe54e652676ea2`.
- next: if unattended provider unlock is still required, create a separate
  credential broker contract using OS keyring/pass/secret-tool semantics, not
  repo `.env` storage.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0167 CapabilityOS permissioned constraint-break route started

- status: active
- trigger: founder clarified that Hive Mind should be the actual executor,
  while GenesisOS and CapabilityOS should have high freedom to loosen
  constraints, propose bypass/unblock paths, and ask the user what is allowed.
- scope: add a recommendation-only CapabilityOS route that names high-freedom
  unblock options and permission questions, with `executor=hivemind`.
- codex_ownership: `CapabilityOS/capabilityos/catalog.py`,
  `CapabilityOS/capabilityos/cli.py`, `CapabilityOS/tests/test_cli.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0167-capabilityos-permissioned-constraint-break-route.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, ledger, and worklog.
- deferred: Hive execution consumption of this route is a follow-up contract;
  this slice only creates the route surface.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0167 CapabilityOS permissioned constraint-break route closed

- status: done

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0167-capabilityos-permissioned-constraint-break-route.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, worklog, and ledger.
- result: CapabilityOS now exposes
  `python -m capabilityos.cli constraint-break --task ... --blocker ...
  --json`, returning `capabilityos.constraint_break_route.v1` with
  high-freedom proposal-only unblock options, user permission questions,
  no-secret-storage privacy policy, and `execution_policy.executor=hivemind`.
- verification: `cd CapabilityOS && python -m unittest tests/test_cli.py`
  passed 14/14; CLI smoke for provider PIN gate emitted
  `executor=hivemind`, `capabilityos_executes_tools=false`, and non-empty
  permission questions.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_30fe0c4db049738a`.
- monitor: `health=attention`, with expected dirty alerts for active child
  repo implementation work in memoryOS, GenesisOS, and CapabilityOS.
- next: wire Hive Mind to consume this route as an execution preflight so
  high-freedom proposals become operator-approved Hive actions instead of
  direct CapabilityOS execution.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0163 negative evidence and Genesis combinatorial creativity started

- status: active

  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and ledger closeout.
- role_artifacts: `.aios/invocations/asc-0163-negative-evidence-creativity/**`
  was created plan-only before edits; MemoryOS returned
  `rtrace_0fa028fc49623cad`, CapabilityOS routed local recommendation-only
  tools, GenesisOS returned `failure_as_feature`, `alien_domain`, and related
  branch types, and Hive stayed `execute_allowed=false`.
- delegated_boundary: child repo implementation is deferred to follow-up work
  packets; no MemoryOS acceptance, CapabilityOS execution, or GenesisOS code
  mutation happens in this contract.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0163 negative evidence and Genesis combinatorial creativity closed

  benchmark protocol now treat GenesisOS as a combinatorial creativity layer
  that turns discomfort, negative evidence, founder patterns, and distant

  closeout returned `health=watch` and `alerts=0`.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_e4e49cb5227186cb`
  through explicit `--override-authority`.
- next: split ASC-0163 into child repo implementation packets: MemoryOS
  failure-memory drafts, CapabilityOS negative route observations, GenesisOS
  recombination candidate output, and Hive richer failed/degraded/false-success
  receipts.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0155 MemoryOS Gate sleep consolidation started

- status: starting
- trigger: founder proposed reverse-engineering prompt-Agent execution loop
  pairs from MemoryOS/runtime traces so each user's Gate can become a
  personalized operator interface, with sleep-like consolidation before
  fine-tuning.
- scope: myworld sleep extraction script, Gate pack artifact, chat router pack
  projection, focused tests, and docs.
- codex_ownership: `scripts/aios_gate_sleep.py`,
  `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_gate_sleep.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0155-memoryos-gate-sleep-consolidation.md`.
- delegated_boundary: MemoryOS is read-only in this contract; no model
  fine-tuning and no child repo implementation.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0155 MemoryOS Gate sleep consolidation closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_gate_sleep.py`, `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,

  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0155-memoryos-gate-sleep-consolidation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- result: AIOS now has a V1 Gate sleep loop. It extracts prompt -> Gate
  decision -> route/substrate -> response pairs from `.aios/chat`, overlays
  accepted MemoryOS hints, writes `.aios/gate/founder/gate_pack.json`, and
  projects that pack into later chat `gate_decision` artifacts.
- final_sleep_report: `gatepack_843ecd92b888c664`, `10` source loop pairs,
  `12` accepted MemoryOS hints, `finetune_ready=false`.
- rules: `ask_missing_inputs_before_provider`,
  `current_info_requires_source`, `memoryos_context_before_execution`, and
  `provider_is_substrate_not_identity`.
- verification: focused Gate sleep/chat tests passed 14/14; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0155.myworld.result.json` passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 322/322.
- next: create the evaluation/rollback/privacy gate required before any local
  Gate model fine-tuning, or add a CapabilityOS current-info/weather adapter
  so the learned Gate route can execute with source evidence.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0154 AIOS chat gate agent started

- status: starting
- trigger: founder showed `오늘 날씨는 ?` being handled as a lightweight local
  turn and clarified that AIOS needs a Gate/Chair Agent to replace the hidden
  Codex CLI operator judgment before provider chatbot/CLI substrate use.
- scope: myworld chat router and docs only.
- codex_ownership: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0154-aios-chat-gate-agent.md`.
- delegated_boundary: no child repo implementation; CapabilityOS current-info
  route is named but not executed in this contract.

  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0154-aios-chat-gate-agent.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- result: every chat turn now writes an `aios.chat.gate_decision.v1`
  artifact. The Gate can route normally, ask for missing location, require a
  current-info route, or answer AIOS architecture directly.
- behavior: `오늘 날씨는 ?` returns `chosen_substrate=gate_clarification`,
  `route_reason=gate_requires_input`, `provider_execution=held`, and asks for
  location instead of letting a local LLM guess. Provider chatbot/CLI
  architecture questions return `chosen_substrate=aios_gate` and explain
  providers as substrates behind `user -> AIOS Gate -> OS routing -> provider`.
- verification: focused chat/local-app tests passed 23/23; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0154.myworld.result.json` passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 319/319.
- next: add a real CapabilityOS current-info/weather adapter so the Gate can
  answer weather/current factual questions after missing inputs are supplied.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0153 OS observatory visual interface started

- status: starting
- scope: make MemoryOS knowledge accumulation, CapabilityOS route/search
  activity, GenesisOS divergence, Hive execution, and MyWorld control visible
  as operating-system surfaces in the Control Center instead of raw logs.
- codex_ownership: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0153-os-observatory-visual-interface.md`.
- genesis_input: use the current GenesisOS divergence frame that treats AIOS
  visibility like infrastructure/city planning and failure boundaries as
  useful signals.
- delegated_boundary: child OS internals remain read-only for this contract;
  MyWorld surfaces their existing receipts, graph counts, and route evidence.

- result: Control Center now has an OS Observatory section that shows
  MemoryOS knowledge graph counts, CapabilityOS route/search planner evidence,
  GenesisOS worldline branches, Hive execution status, and MyWorld control
  status as visual lanes/cards instead of raw logs.
- memoryos_snapshot: final refresh showed `198177` nodes, `305712` edges,
  `169` memory objects, `44` accepted, `117` draft, `8` rejected,
  `749` retrieval traces, and `34` hyperedges. Counts apply review-ledger
  overlay instead of trusting base object status only.
- capabilityos_snapshot: `6` capability cards, `48` observations, `97` gaps,
  and top routes including Hive execution harness, MemoryOS context build,
  MemoryOS import-run, and web research route.
- visual_evidence: `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-os-observatory.png`.

- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_686de2e3b186ea12`.
- next: promote ASC-0151 so generated promotion seeds become visible in a
  review queue, then connect OS Observatory cards to drill-down views.

- trigger: founder pasted the Control Center answer to `너는 누구니`; the
  response still began as a route receipt instead of an AIOS self-description.
- result: identity questions now start with `나는 AIOS야.` and explain that the
  visible speaker is the AIOS control/interface layer over myworld, Hive Mind,
  MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, and provider substrates.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_chat.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`;

  watcher result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0152.myworld.result.json` passed;
  HTTP `/api/chat` smoke in `control-center` returned identity-first text.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_d6a6940e01e78aa8`.
- next: continue ASC-0151 so generated promotion contract seeds become visible

- result: Control Center now shows Quick Actions above `Talk to AIOS`, seeds
  useful prompts into the chat composer, and renders a Friction Radar from
  monitor next-actions so end users can see current needs without reading
  dispatch or monitor JSON.
- genesis_input: GenesisOS critique classified the empty/hidden-action

- result: Control Center now has an inline `Conversation / Talk to AIOS` panel using the existing `/chat` WebSocket router, with same-origin `POST /api/chat` fallback when `8766` is not reachable through SSH/Tailscale. Responses show chosen substrate, route reason, MemoryOS draft id, cost, and artifact refs.
- evidence: CLI smoke wrote `.aios/chat/control-center-smoke/`; WebSocket `/chat` smoke returned `chat_response ok=true` with substrate `ollama_qwen` and draft `chatdraft_1875a2b97d46c242`; visual screenshot `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-inline-chat.png`.

- delegated_boundary: child repo execution remains behind accepted contracts, dispatch packets, and Hive verification; this slice only creates plan-only session artifacts from user goals.
- note: this should make the browser surface behave as `user -> AIOS session envelope -> OS role artifacts -> bounded executor assignment`, not as a direct Codex/Claude prompt box.

- result: round controller now consumes loop-policy `open_contract_order` before dispatch, normalizes inline `repos: myworld`, writes `policy_dispatch_decision` events, and records explicit skip reasons instead of crashing on unsafe verification gates.
- dogfood: policy-bound ticks created/sent `ASC-0097`, created `ASC-0107`, escalated `ASC-0114`, created verifier dispatch records for `ASC-0115`/`ASC-0116`/`ASC-0117`, sent `ASC-0122`, and logged unsafe-gate send errors for older verifier contracts.

- codex_ownership: `docs/AIOS_ADDRESS_SPACE.md`, `scripts/aios_address.py`, `tests/test_aios_address.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0099-aios-address-space.md`.
- delegated_boundary: child repo native commands remain follow-up work packets for MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, and Hive after the control-plane resolver passes.
- note: this slice treats filesystem paths as storage refs and typed `aios://` addresses as cross-OS identities.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0099/0100 routed

- status: done
- changed: `docs/AIOS_ADDRESS_SPACE.md`, `scripts/aios_address.py`, `tests/test_aios_address.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0099-aios-address-space.md`, `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0100-provider-reroute-not-avoidance.md`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_address.py`; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_address.py`; `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json`.
- result: `aios://` resolver indexes contracts, memory objects, capabilities, and Hive runs; child watcher now reroutes through provider auth/PIN/backpressure blocks instead of stopping after one fallback. ASC-0099 child packets reached collected/held state for MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, and Hive; held local output still requires verifier.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0101 production praxis gate closed

- status: done
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0101-aios-production-praxis-gate.md`, `docs/AIOS_PRODUCTION_PRAXIS.md`, `scripts/aios_work_praxis.py`, `tests/test_aios_work_praxis.py`, `tests/fixtures/praxis/valid_praxis.json`.
- evidence: Hugging Face plugin paper search used as external-resource dogfood; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_work_praxis.py`; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_work_praxis.py`; dispatch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0101.myworld.result.json`.
- decision: the failure is primarily an AIOS gate problem, not just an agent training problem. Production work now has a required praxis envelope for MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, Hive, external resources, and specialist assignment.
- next: wire this praxis gate into dispatch creation or the visual control application flow so missing OS usage blocks non-trivial production tasks automatically.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0102 dispatch praxis binding closed

- evidence: MemoryOS context `aios://memory/mem_5012d57c2c4acbf6`; CapabilityOS routes `cap_memoryos_context_build`, `cap_capabilityos_recommendation`, `cap_hivemind_execution_harness`; GenesisOS reframe recorded in praxis JSON; Hive gate `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_work_praxis.py`; dispatch packet `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0102.myworld.json`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_dispatch.py tests/test_aios_work_praxis.py`; `python scripts/aios_work_praxis.py validate docs/praxis/ASC-0102-dispatch-praxis-binding.json --json`; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json`.
- result: `praxis_required: true` contracts now require `send --praxis <json>` before inbox packet creation. Valid praxis is embedded in the packet; missing/invalid praxis holds the dispatch. MemoryOS writeback draft: `mem_e4a9c7fe7d342598`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0103 ask interface closed

- verification: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_ask.py tests/test_aios_launcher.py tests/test_aios_invoke.py`; `python scripts/aios_work_praxis.py validate docs/praxis/ASC-0103-aios-ask-interface.json --json`; `python scripts/aios_ask.py "AIOS ask smoke" --write .aios/asks/asc-0103-smoke --json`; `bash bin/aios --root . ask "AIOS launcher ask smoke" --write .aios/asks/asc-0103-bin-smoke --json`.
- result: `bin/aios ask "goal" --json` is now the first direct AIOS work-instruction interface. It writes plan-only ask, invocation, praxis, and instruction artifacts without bypassing contract/dispatch authority.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0104 ask contract seed closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_ask.py`, `tests/test_aios_ask.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0104-ask-contract-seed.md`, `docs/praxis/ASC-0104-ask-contract-seed.json`, `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`.
- evidence: MemoryOS context `aios://memory/mem_87c91dc592c3b649`; CapabilityOS routes `cap_hivemind_execution_harness`, `cap_memoryos_context_build`, `cap_capabilityos_recommendation`; GenesisOS reframe in praxis; Hive gate `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_ask.py`.

- delegated_boundary: `ASC-0084` remains hivemind-owned and is being processed through `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo hivemind`.
- note: raw inbox count is not the operative queue; pending means accepted work packets without result packets.

- verification: confirmed `hivemind/.runs/aios_dna_debate/round_1` through `round_5` and `final_state.md`; child watcher result `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0084.hivemind.result.json` passed.
- result: AIOS DNA debate converged `accept_with_dissent` on an 8-invariant package; downstream DNA spec contract is now the next clean work item.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0089 collected

- result: Hive chose `pick_B1`; ASC-0088 should be superseded by a tiny AIOS Agent Interface spec contract.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0093 accepted

- status: accepted
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0093-aios-agent-interface-tiny-spec.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.

- verification: CapabilityOS focused tests passed 17/17; Hive focused tests passed 15/15 after fixing `claude` policy-blocked fallback ordering; child watcher focused unittest passed 7/7; `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed; final monitor returned `health=clear`.
- result: ASC-0081 closed. CapabilityOS now routes over `codex`, `claude`, `gemini`, and `local`; Hive provider-loop recognizes `gemini`; child watcher can attempt `gemini` and treats `local` as a verifier-held local-worker substrate. Child repo durability commits: CapabilityOS `be22e98`, Hive `e835f28`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0094 fallback verifier started

- verification: Hive `python -m py_compile hivemind/provider_loop.py hivemind/hive.py` passed; Hive `python -m pytest tests/test_provider_loop.py -v` passed 13/13; dispatch results collected for hivemind and myworld; final monitor returned `health=clear`.
- result: ASC-0094 closed. Hive commit `6e0bde1` added `hive.provider_fallback_verification.v1` and `hive provider-loop verify-fallback`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0095 provider output projection closed

- status: done
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0095-provider-output-projection.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.

- verification: `bash -n scripts/aios_pingpong.sh`; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_pingpong.py`; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`; dispatch watch result `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0096.myworld.result.json`.
- result: pingpong now classifies provider access denial and provider backpressure, then retries the same prompt through `codex -> claude -> local` when `AIOS_PINGPONG_AGENT_FALLBACKS=1`. Release hook wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_4a44670b379ca4ea`.

- deferred: child repo execution, provider CLI execution, and auto-acceptance remain out of scope.
- note: ASC-0105 was already taken by `ASC-0105-aios-dna-canonical-spec`; the end-user surface is continuing as ASC-0109 and the transient `asc-0105` dispatch will be reconciled as an ID-collision artifact.

- result: `docs/AIOS_DNA.md` now canonically captures the ASC-0084 Hive verdict with 8 invariants, interaction map, amendment clause, and dissent register. DNA lint reports missing citations without retroactively blocking old contracts. Release writeback wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_922593c0edb5bbac`.

- trigger: founder asked whether MemoryOS really stores founder work style or whether Claude only misses it because it is uncommitted.
- diagnosis: MemoryOS contract closeout writeback works, but founder directives were only incidental `origin=mixed` mentions; no `origin=founder_directive` path existed.

- result: final baseline `117` contracts, governance score `0.49`, `health_color=red`, `governance_theater=false` after ASC-0106 closed with evidence. `scripts/aios_self_check.sh` now emits `GOVERNANCE_THEATER` when the recent contract stream is evidence-poor. Release writeback wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_2637ee7237543f54`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0118 readiness reconciliation binding started

- planned_changes: `scripts/aios_readiness.py`, `tests/test_aios_readiness.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0118-readiness-reconciliation-binding.md`.
- deferred: deleting `.aios/inbox/myworld/asc-0105.myworld.json`; the point is to preserve history and classify it through reconciliation.
- trigger: self-check reported `READINESS_DROP level=5` while monitor was clear because readiness ignored the existing ASC-0105/ASC-0109 reconciliation entry.

- result: readiness returned to `L6 repeatable` with `ready=true` and no `READINESS_DROP` self-check alert. The stale `asc-0105` inbox artifact remains on disk and is ignored only via exact reconciliation; a running packet no longer fails its own readiness gate. Release writeback wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_49585c35d8301405`.

- changed: `scripts/aios_os_activity.py`, `tests/test_aios_os_activity.py`, `scripts/aios_self_check.sh`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0119-os-activity-evidence.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_os_activity.py`; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_os_activity.py`; `bash -n scripts/aios_self_check.sh`; `python scripts/aios_os_activity.py --json`; `bash scripts/aios_self_check.sh`; `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'`; `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py watch --repo myworld --dispatch-id asc-0119 --once`; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --write --json`.
- result: `aios_os_activity.py` reported `ghost_repos=[]`; self-check no longer emits `CROSS_OS_GHOST GenesisOS` when recent invocation receipts show `role_statuses.genesis=passed`. Release writeback wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_561d7633490e0f56`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0056 memory draft pipeline closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_coevolution/memory_pulse.sh`, `scripts/aios_memory_review_proposer.py`, `tests/test_aios_memory_review_proposer.py`, `tests/test_aios_accepted_memory_surfaces.py`, `docs/AIOS_MEMORY_REVIEW.md`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0056-memoryos-draft-pipeline-closure.md`, `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- verification: `bash scripts/aios_coevolution/memory_pulse.sh`; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_memory_review_proposer.py`; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_memory_review_proposer.py tests/test_aios_accepted_memory_surfaces.py tests/test_aios_coevolution.py`; `python -m pytest memoryOS/tests/test_doc_radar_ingest.py -q`; `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'`.
- result: Memory pulse now reports current importer counts (`imported=26`, `warnings=0` on dogfood). Review proposal batches `.aios/memory_review_proposals/mrev_115b2869e62b4d0e.json` and `.aios/memory_review_proposals/mrev_e3b44539adc63383.json` each proposed 32 accepts and 8 needs-more-evidence without auto-approval. Operator approval of `mem_561d7633490e0f56` proved accepted memory surfaces in `context build`. Release writeback wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_ee01f19716c4afe2`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0111 founder memory activated

- status: done
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0111-founder-behavior-ingestion.md`, `docs/AIOS_FOUNDER_INGESTION.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, runtime `memoryOS/memory/reviews.jsonl`.
- verification: approved 10 high-signal `origin=founder_directive` drafts via `python -m memoryos.cli --root memoryOS drafts approve ...`; `python -m memoryos.cli --root memoryOS search "AIOS완성 공진화 memoryOS capabilityOS hive mind founder" --origin founder_directive --json`; `python -m memoryos.cli --root memoryOS context build --task "AIOS완성 공진화 memoryOS capabilityOS hive mind founder directive" --for hive --project AIOS --json --explain --include-excluded`; `python -m memoryos.cli --root memoryOS context build --task "founder role delegated living organism 작업방식 memoryOS" --for hive --project AIOS --json --explain --include-excluded`; `bash scripts/aios_self_check.sh`; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --write --json`; `python scripts/aios_readiness.py --json`.
- result: founder directives are no longer draft-only. MemoryOS now reports `10` accepted founder directives and `75` remaining drafts; context traces `rtrace_31b18b1d2fd7c0aa` and `rtrace_a25c117e6fae9cbf` selected founder memories for Hive-facing context.
- next: execute ASC-0110 retrieval repair so accepted founder directives rank reliably instead of being excluded as `task_no_match` on mixed-language prompts.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0110 retrieval audit slice done

- status: partial
- changed: `scripts/aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py`, `tests/test_aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py`, `scripts/aios_self_check.sh`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0110-memoryos-retrieval-broken.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py`; `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py`; `python scripts/aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py --json` reported `retrieval_rate=1.0 hits=4/4`; `bash -n scripts/aios_self_check.sh`; `bash scripts/aios_self_check.sh` reported `retrieval=passed=true rate=1.0 hits=4/4`; `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 247 tests.
- result: self-check now has an active MemoryOS retrieval tripwire. It verifies accepted founder directives actually surface through `context build` instead of trusting ingest/writeback.
- next: MemoryOS-owned WP-0110-A should decide whether to change retrieval semantics for drafts or update the contract wording to accepted-memory retrieval only.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0110 MemoryOS retrieval closed

- status: done
- changed: `memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`, `memoryOS/tests/test_retrieval.py`,
  `memoryOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0110-memoryos-retrieval-broken.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`;
  `cd memoryOS && python -m pytest tests/test_retrieval.py -q` passed 2/2;
  `cd memoryOS && python -m pytest tests/test_sprint4.py -q` passed 964/964;
  `python scripts/aios_memory_retrieval_audit.py --json` reported
  `retrieval_rate=1.0 hits=4/4`; `bash scripts/aios_self_check.sh` reported
  `retrieval=passed=true rate=1.0 hits=4/4`;
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 247/247.
- decision: this was not a commit visibility problem. MemoryOS runtime store is
  intentionally gitignored; the real gaps were draft-only founder memories and
  content-only/coarse retrieval ranking. `context build` remains accepted-only,
  while `search` can surface draft candidates for review.
- result: accepted founder directives now rank through content plus
  privacy-safe metadata such as `origin`, `project`, `raw_refs`,
  `reframe_class`, `source_path`, and `evidence_refs`.
- release: child repo commit `memoryOS/ca7c39a`; dispatch release recorded
  `asc-0110`; direct closeout writeback wrote MemoryOS draft
  `mem_7470a9fdae76bcc2` because the old manual dispatch lacked a created
  event for the automatic release hook.
- decision: verifier closeout accepts the wording correction:
  "drafts are review candidates, not Hive context inputs."

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0067 unified invocation pipeline closed

- status: done
- changed: `docs/contracts/ASC-0067-unified-os-invocation-pipeline.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_invoke.py`;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_invoke.py` passed 7/7;
  `python scripts/aios_invoke.py --goal "AIOS should route one task through all OS roles" --json` returned `overall_status=passed`;
  `python scripts/aios_invoke.py --goal "AIOS should route one task through all OS roles" --plan-only --write .aios/invocations/asc-0067-smoke --json` returned `overall_status=passed`;
  `python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_aios_*.py'` passed 247/247;
  `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` returned `health=clear`.
- evidence: `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0067.myworld.result.json` and
  `.aios/invocations/asc-0067-smoke/receipt.json`.
- result: one goal now produces explicit GenesisOS, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  Hive, dispatch, goal, and receipt artifacts. GenesisOS remains local role
  invocation in V1 because the dispatch registry does not yet support
  `GenesisOS` inbox/outbox routing.
- release: `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id asc-0067`
  wrote MemoryOS closeout draft `mem_17e55b7b3e48c01e`.
- next: use ASC-0067 as the required route substrate for ASC-0077 semantic
  alignment or ASC-0082 product sprint driver, rather than adding more ad-hoc
  direct Codex work.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0087 provider prompt bootstrap closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_provider_prompts.py`,
  `scripts/templates/provider_prompts/*.tmpl`,
  `tests/test_aios_provider_prompts.py`, `docs/AIOS_PROVIDER_PROMPTS.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0087-provider-prompt-bootstrap.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_provider_prompts.py`;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_provider_prompts.py` passed 7/7;
  `python scripts/aios_provider_prompts.py detect --json` detected
  Claude, Codex, and Gemini; `bootstrap --dry-run --json` planned 2 writes
  and performed 0; temp-home bootstrap wrote a Claude marker block;
  full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 254/254; monitor returned clear.
- live dogfood: safe-merge appended exactly one AIOS marker block to
  `/home/user/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `/home/user/.codex/AGENTS.md`.
  Existing content outside the marker was preserved. Gemini remains detected
  but skipped as experimental.
- dispatch: action-policy escalation was operator-released; watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0087.myworld.result.json` passed.
- release: `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py release --dispatch-id asc-0087`
  wrote MemoryOS closeout draft `mem_e873e1a68ab3e200`.
- next: ASC-0080 can reuse this bootstrapper from native install; ASC-0079
  remains the only active escalated dispatch.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0079 Hive public alpha hardening closed

- status: done
- changed: `hivemind/README.md`, `hivemind/docs/HIVE_PUBLIC_ALPHA.md`,
  `hivemind/tests/test_production_hardening.py`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0079-hivemind-public-alpha-hardening.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- dispatch: initial child watcher result was held because Codex provider
  access was denied, Claude had provider backpressure, and local fallback cannot
  be final acceptor. Founder-delegated Codex acted as `codex@hivemind`, then
  `aios_dispatch.watch` produced a passed Hive result packet.
- verification: `cd hivemind && python -m pytest
  tests/test_cli_entrypoint.py tests/test_quickstart.py tests/test_plan_dag.py
  tests/test_production_hardening.py -v` passed 145/145;
  `cd hivemind && python -m pytest -q` passed 341/341;
  `cd hivemind && python -m hivemind.hive demo quickstart --json` exited 0;
  `cd hivemind && python -m hivemind.hive inspect --json` exited 0 with
  verdict `clean`.
- result: Hive commit `9daa35f` documents public-alpha boundaries,
  provider-free onboarding, optional sibling OS integrations, and staged module
  split stop conditions.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0112 AIOS chat wrapper closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_chat.py`, `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,
  `scripts/aios_dashboard_ws.py`, `scripts/aios_launcher.py`,
  `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0112-aios-chat-wrapper.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: `aios_chat_router.py` is now the mandatory chat front door. It
  performs router-first substrate selection, supports `@claude/@codex/@local`
  overrides, writes conversation history, writes cost records, loads MemoryOS
  context when available, and emits MemoryOS-compatible `run_state.json` +
  `memory_drafts.json`.
- interface: `python scripts/aios_chat.py --message ... --conversation ...`
  works, `bin/aios chat ...` delegates to it, and the control app now serves
  `chat.html` backed by the dashboard WebSocket `/chat` route.
- verification: contract watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0112.myworld.result.json` passed; targeted chat
  tests passed 7/7; full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 261/261;
  MemoryOS `import-run --dry-run` accepted a chat run as one planned memory
  object; Web smoke loaded `/chat.html` and received a `/chat` response.
- live: control app restarted on `http://127.0.0.1:9885/` with chat at
  `http://127.0.0.1:9885/chat.html` and WebSocket on `ws://127.0.0.1:9886/chat`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0113 user pattern few-shot started

- status: in_progress
- ownership: Codex will implement the MyWorld extractor/injector, wire draft
  pattern injection into `aios_chat_router.py` and `aios_invoke.py`, and add the
  smallest MemoryOS importer/schema mapping for `user_pattern` drafts.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_pattern_extractor.py`,
  `scripts/aios_few_shot_injector.py`, `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`,
  `scripts/aios_invoke.py`, `tests/test_aios_pattern_extractor.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_few_shot_injector.py`, `memoryOS/memoryos/schema.py`,
  `memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`, `memoryOS/tests/test_pattern_extract.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_USER_PATTERNS.md`, and ASC-0113 closeout docs.
- deferred: real provider prompt transport remains behind provider execution
  binding; this pass injects into the AIOS prompt envelope and records audit
  evidence before any substrate call.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0113 user pattern few-shot closed

  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: extracted 6 draft founder/user patterns into
  `.aios/patterns/founder/patterns.json`; injector writes audit rows to
  `.aios/patterns/founder/injections.jsonl`; chat router now returns
  `patterns_injected`; `aios_invoke` Hive plans now include draft
  `user_patterns`.
- MemoryOS: commit `8a0a4be` preserves `type=user_pattern` and
  `origin=pattern_extracted` through import-run as draft MemoryObjects.
- verification: myworld dispatch result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0113.myworld.result.json` passed; memoryOS dispatch
  result `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0113.memoryOS.result.json` passed; full
  myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 265/265; MemoryOS `tests/test_sprint4.py`
  passed 964/964.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0120 verifier priority precedence closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_loop_policy.py`, `tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0120-verifier-priority-precedence.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: loop policy now classifies accepted contracts by issuer and exposes
  `open_contract_order`, `verifier_starvation_seconds`,
  `priority_inversion_detected`, and `verifier_starvation` warning evidence.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_loop_policy.py`;
  `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_loop_policy.py` passed 4/4;
  `python scripts/aios_loop_policy.py --write docs/AIOS_LOOP_POLICY.md --json`;
  full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 267/267.
- dispatch: first send escalated on action-policy checkpoint, operator release
  created the inbox packet, watcher result
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0120.myworld.result.json` passed, and final release
  wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_da5509a16be7f6a3`.
- decision: the contract's "monitor finding" wording is implemented as a
  policy warning in `aios_loop_policy.py` because ASC-0120's scope owns queue
  policy, not `aios_monitor.py`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0096 Goal Bar closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_goal_bar.py`, `scripts/aios_local_app.py`,

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0096-goal-bar-natural-input.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: local control app now has a Goal Bar that classifies Korean/English
  natural-language requests into deterministic AIOS CLI routes, renders the
  selected command before execution, and requires confirmation before running.
- verification: dispatch `asc-0096-goalbar` watcher passed; focused tests
  passed 17/17; full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 287/287; live
  app at `http://127.0.0.1:9885/` accepted `/api/goal_bar` classify and
  confirmed-execute requests.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_a1b127491f1482d1`.
- note: the contract ID collides with an older closed ASC-0096 file, so this
  execution used dispatch id `asc-0096-goalbar` for unambiguous receipts.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0123 self-check scalar hygiene closed

- status: done
- changed: `scripts/aios_self_check.sh`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0123-self-check-dispatch-health-scalar.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: dispatch-health parsing now consumes complete dispatch status output
  with Python and prints exactly one scalar, avoiding `1\n0` values under
  `pipefail`.
- verification: `bash -n scripts/aios_self_check.sh` passed; `bash
  scripts/aios_self_check.sh` exited 0 and printed `dispatch=1` without the
  previous integer-expression warning.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_e067e4ab638dcbda`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0090 agent identity registry closed

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0090-agent-identity-registry.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: AIOS now has a machine-local agent registry at
  `~/.aios/agents.json` plus a workspace mirror for future agents to inspect.
  The initial registry includes myworld operators and child-OS codex agents.
- verification: dispatch `asc-0090` watcher passed; focused registry tests
  passed 5/5; full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 292/292.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_7e99392705adcae1`.

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0107-citizenship-implementation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: AIOS now has six citizenship classes, an authority decision matrix,
  dispatch release authority audit events, and a policy hard-deny for
  `bind_capability`.
- verification: retry dispatch `asc-0107` watcher passed; full myworld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 301/301.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_123026e80e205898`.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0114 living organism deliberation started

- status: in_progress
- ownership: Codex is acting as founder-delegated operator and Hive artifact
  producer under ASC-0114. Hive owns the deliberation artifacts; myworld owns
  the discovery summary and closeout records.
- semantic_handshake: AIOS smart contract, dispatch packet, memory draft,
  capability route, hive execution, and stop condition meanings confirmed;
  ambiguous_terms=[]
- expected files: `hivemind/.runs/living_organism_debate/**`,
  `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-hive-living-organism-debate-result.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0114-living-organism-hive-deliberation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- constraint: no L2/L3 implementation contracts or role-substitution scripts
  will be created under this contract.

## 2026-05-13 KST - codex - ASC-0114 living organism deliberation closed

- status: done
- changed: `hivemind/.runs/living_organism_debate/**` (ignored Hive run
  artifacts), `hivemind/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/discoveries/2026-05-13-hive-living-organism-debate-result.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0114-living-organism-hive-deliberation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: Hive converged on `proceed_role_substitution_only`: build leased,
  scoped, expiring, auditable routine-founder substitution; defer executable
  organism dynamics and swarm reproduction.
- verification: every proposer/critic/extender voice is at least 600 words;
  all 8 probes are mapped in `final_state.md`; discovery summary is 239 words;
  dispatch `asc-0114-closeout2` watcher passed; full myworld tests passed
  301/301.
- hive_durability: committed Hive worklog as `af2e1fd Record living organism
  deliberation`; debate artifacts remain in ignored `.runs/` as local run
  receipts matching prior Hive debate convention.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_18cfbb2cd700e98c`.
- next: draft a separate `ASC-0124-role-substitution-lease-schema` only after
  ASC-0114 closeout is accepted.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0125 GenesisOS dispatch surface closed

- status: done

  `docs/AIOS_WORK_DISPATCH.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0125-genesisos-dispatch-surface.md`, and
  `docs/contracts/README.md`.
- result: `GenesisOS` is now a first-class dispatch target for create/send,
  status, collect, transition, and watch commands. ASC-0069 can now write a
  real `.aios/inbox/GenesisOS/asc-0069.GenesisOS.json` packet instead of being
  handled as an out-of-band child repo edit.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests/test_aios_dispatch.py` passed; actual
  `send --repo GenesisOS --dispatch-id asc-0069` wrote the packet; dispatch
  watcher `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0125-closeout.myworld.result.json` passed;
  full myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 304/304.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_f62c6029b6b70fec`.

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0069-genesis-prompt-prison-critic.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: GenesisOS now has a deterministic advisory prompt-prison critic with
  six signatures and CLI JSON output. MyWorld can scan open contracts and
  surface `genesis_prompt_prison_advisory` as an info-level monitor finding.
- verification: GenesisOS watcher
  `.aios/outbox/GenesisOS/asc-0069.GenesisOS.result.json` passed; myworld
  watcher `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0069.myworld.result.json` passed; full
  myworld `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 304/304.
- genesis_durability: committed GenesisOS work as
  `0f681a9 Add prompt prison critic`.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_15edb8ef978664da`.
- next: continue ASC-0126 MemoryOS retrieval real fix, because Agent(Retriever)
  still has pending work and monitor reports `asc-0126` awaiting collection or
  watcher result.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0126 MemoryOS retrieval real fix closed

- status: done
- changed: `memoryOS/memoryos/cli.py`, `memoryOS/tests/test_retrieval.py`,
  `memoryOS/scripts/retrieval_regression_probe.py`,
  `memoryOS/docs/RETRIEVAL.md`, `memoryOS/docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0126-memoryos-retrieval-real-fix.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: MemoryOS context retrieval no longer reports `signal_coverage=0.0`
  when deterministic text-score ranking selected relevant accepted memories.
  `signal_coverage` now counts positive retrieval score components as
  auditable local signal.
- verification: live probes returned positive items and
  `signal_coverage=1.0` for `AIOS founder operator pattern`,
  `GenesisOS prompt prison`, and `CapabilityOS router`; full MemoryOS pytest
  passed 2017/2017; full MyWorld AIOS tests passed 304/304; dispatch watcher
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0126.memoryOS.result.json` passed.
- memoryos_durability: committed MemoryOS work as
  `2aeae86 Fix retrieval signal coverage`.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_6c2bf60aa5728f69`.
- next: ASC-0127 remains escalated and should be handled as the 5-persona
  cognitive architecture evaluation axis, now with Genesis and Memory both
  backed by real execution evidence.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0127 5-persona axis closed

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0127-5-persona-cognitive-architecture-axis.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: AIOS now has an advisory cognitive-function axis separate from
  governance audit: Wrapper, Retriever, Router, Philosophy, Sovereign, plus
  `persona_composite`.
- baseline: last-20 closed contracts scored `persona_composite=0.45`,
  `wrapper_score=0.75`, `retriever_score=0.05`, `router_score=0.2`,
  `philosophy_score=0.25`, `sovereign_score=1.0`.
- verification: persona audit focused tests passed 3/3; monitor
  `--require-key persona_composite` passed; dispatch watcher
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0127.myworld.result.json` passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 307/307.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_7e6b165c47bb573b`.
- next: use the low Retriever/Router/Philosophy scores to prioritize contracts
  that force persona invocation evidence into future non-trivial work.

## 2026-05-14 KST - codex - ASC-0124 ecosystem substrate debate closed

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0124-hive-debate-ecosystem-substrate.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: Hive completed a six-round, three-voice deliberation and converged on
  `proceed_hybrid`: protocol core as the actual agent substrate, optional
  container/VM packaging later, open-source role floors, projection-safe
  federation, export/exit semantics, and governance gates.
- verification: Hive watcher
  `.aios/outbox/hivemind/asc-0124.hivemind.result.json` passed; myworld
  watcher `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0124.myworld.result.json` passed; full

  generated proposed contracts `ASC-0128` through `ASC-0142`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: goal inbox processing no longer emits legacy `auto_promote` or
  `skipped=True`. Each packet gets an explicit classification and source-linked
  response. Repeated runs preserve explicit responses as `previously_processed`
  with `silently_skipped=0`.
- dogfood: current `.aios/goal_inbox` processed 15 packets into 15
  `auto_promote_distinct` contract candidates; all 11 `uri` packets received
  distinct responses whose generated contract bodies cite the originating
  `goal_id`.
- verification: focused tests passed 5/5; watcher
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0115.myworld.result.json` passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 308/308.

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0143-aios-session-envelope-runtime-binding.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: AIOS now writes `aios.session_envelope.v1` for invocations and can
  bind that envelope into dispatch packets with `--session-envelope`. Watcher
  results echo the same envelope projection, so Codex executor work can be
  traced back to MemoryOS/CapabilityOS/GenesisOS/Hive preparation.
- provider note: provider-native goal/loop modes are converging on the same
  pattern. AIOS should absorb them as replaceable executor substrates under
  the session envelope, not treat each provider UX as the operating system.
- verification: focused invoke/dispatch tests passed 29/29; ASC-0143 watcher
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0143.myworld.result.json` passed; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 309/309.

  promotes provider-substrate absorption to the immediate next contract.

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0080-aios-native-installation.md`,
  `docs/contracts/README.md`, and `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- result: AIOS now has a reversible user-space installer that can write a
  global `aios` launcher, `systemd --user` service, and optional desktop entry.
  The service model runs `aios_local_app.py up` before holding
  `aios_round_controller.py run --execute-children` alive under
  `Restart=always`.
- interaction: end-user surface is intentionally short: `aios install`,
  `aios status --json`, `aios open`, `aios stop`, and `aios uninstall`.
  Detailed systemd/Tailscale/GUI behavior lives in `docs/AIOS_NATIVE_INSTALL.md`.
- verification: focused installer/launcher tests passed 16/16; full MyWorld
  `test_aios_*.py` suite passed 329/329; watcher
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0080.myworld.result.json` passed.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_2b784c0463d04f8f`.
- note: verification did not perform a live install into `/home/user`; it used
  dry-run/status plus temp-home unit tests. Live activation remains an explicit
  operator command: `aios install`.
- next: surface install/service reachability in the Control Center as a
  first-run/onboarding state.

- intent: expose whether AIOS is installed, running as a background service,
  reachable through the local UI, and looping, without making the user read
  systemd/PID details in the main interface.
- deferred: no live install into `~/.local` or `~/.config`; no provider or

- result: Control Center now surfaces AIOS runtime state as Command,
  Background, Control Center, and Loop cards. Snapshot field `installation`
  derives launcher/service/desktop targets from temporary `HOME` in tests and
  runtime PID/loop state from `.aios/run`.

  `contract_seed`, `dispatch_preview`, and `next_action` for review.
- guardrail: no accept or dispatch button was added; promotion remains a

- result: first paper draft now frames AIOS as an agent operating layer that
  wraps provider CLIs for long-running work, includes direct-CLI vs AIOS
  evaluation design, and explicitly measures operational overhead.
- dogfood: paper drafting exposed watcher verification-command constraints and
  checkpoint escalation for paper/legal-risk wording; both are now recorded as
  operational overhead/evaluation material.
- verification: `tests/test_aios_paper.py` passed 3/3; watcher

  Cloudflare long-running agents. The paper explicitly narrows AIOS's claim
  instead of claiming firstness.

- result: benchmark protocol now defines matched direct-provider-CLI versus
  AIOS-wrapped-provider runs, required artifacts, outcome metrics, overhead
  metrics, exclusions, and negative evidence policy.
- founder signal absorbed: MemoryOS needs failure memory and CapabilityOS needs
  bad-tool evidence; the protocol now includes

- result: Hive Mind now has a non-executing permission preflight that consumes
  CapabilityOS high-freedom unblock routes, preserves user permission
  questions, and keeps execution authority with Hive.
- evidence: Hive tests passed 3/3; Hive CLI preflight over
  `tests/fixtures/constraint_break_route.json` returned
  `status=operator_checkpoint_required`, `executor=hivemind`,
  `execute_now=false`, and no stop conditions. Dispatch results for
  `asc-0168` were collected; the child watcher held the Hive packet only
  because implementation files were already dirty before the watcher ran.
- memory_writeback: release wrote MemoryOS draft `mem_030055a087ee7981`
  through explicit `--override-authority`.

- status: done
- scope: `docs/AIOS_BASE_ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md`, `docs/README.md`, worklog,

- result: consolidated the base definition of AIOS around purpose, inputs,
  outputs, behavior loop, local-first infra, current evidence, weak spots, and
  required invariants before more feature contracts are added.
- evidence: `scripts/aios_invoke.py --goal "base architecture audit smoke"
  --json` passed all role surfaces; `scripts/aios_readiness.py --json`
  reported `L6 repeatable`; `scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reported
  `health=attention` due child repo dirty state rather than pending dispatch.
- decision: the base is coherent enough to continue, but product stability now
  depends on cleanup/commit discipline, richer MemoryOS context packs, real
  current-info/tool adapters, GenesisOS priority influence, and native service
  dogfooding.
- next: close or commit child repo dirty state before stacking more child-repo
  implementation work.

  `internal_evidence_synthesizer` or `ollama`, rejects private markers in model
  names, and writes only `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json`.
- evidence: live HTTP call set `mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer` and returned
  `schema_version=aios.gate_chair_runtime_api.v1` with
  `runtime_config_path=.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json`. Visual smoke
  captured `.aios/screenshots/control-gate-chair-runtime-switch.png` showing
  `Use Internal` and `Try Ollama` in the Runtime band.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app
  tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_control_snapshot

## 2026-05-16 13:27 KST — codex — Gate Chair fallback visibility

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and worklog.
- intent: make `Try Ollama` honest at the moment of interaction. If the
  runtime candidate is saved but the local `ollama` command is absent, the
  Control Center should say that AIOS will remain on the internal Chair
  fallback instead of implying a provider-grade Chair is active.
- result: Runtime switch feedback now appends `command missing` and
  `internal fallback expected` when `/api/gate_chair_runtime` reports a saved
  Ollama candidate without an executable local `ollama` command.
- evidence: live `POST /api/gate_chair_runtime` with `mode=ollama` returned
  `command_available=false` and
  `fallback_expected=internal_evidence_synthesizer_until_ollama_exists`. A live
  `/api/chat` architecture smoke then answered that
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json` requested Ollama model
  `qwen2.5:7b`, but this machine lacks the `ollama` command and is internally
  falling back. The runtime config was restored to
  `internal_evidence_synthesizer` after the smoke.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app
  tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_control_snapshot
  tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval -v` passed 51/51; `node --check

  scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py` passed.
- next: connect a real non-internal Chair runtime only after its command is
  available, then use `Eval Chair` to require `promotion_ready=true` before it
  becomes the default conversational front door.
- deferred: installing Ollama or changing provider credentials/PIN handling.

## 2026-05-16 13:29 KST — codex — ASC-0174 monitor reconciliation hygiene

- status: done
- scope: `docs/AIOS_MONITOR_RECONCILIATIONS.json`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and monitor verification.
- intent: remove the current false-positive monitor warning for ASC-0174
  without weakening global stale-status detection. The monitor already treats
  `accepted -> closed` as expected; the remaining alert is an exact historical
  reconciliation that stopped at `current=accepted` while the contract later
  closed.
- result: updated the exact ASC-0174 reconciliation to
  `reconcile-asc-0174-created-proposed-then-closed` with `current=closed`.
  Global monitor behavior remains unchanged, so unrelated `proposed -> closed`
  drift still alerts unless a contract-specific reconciliation exists.
- evidence: live `python scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json` now applies
  the ASC-0174 reconciliation and no longer emits
  `dispatch_contract_status_stale`; remaining alerts are child repo dirty
  states only.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_monitor -v` passed 12/12;
  `python -m json.tool docs/AIOS_MONITOR_RECONCILIATIONS.json >/dev/null`
  passed.
- next: triage child repo dirty states before stacking more child-repo
  implementation.
- deferred: child repo dirty triage; those alerts must remain until repo owners
  close or commit the work.

## 2026-05-16 13:31 KST — codex — Child repo dirty triage

- status: done
- scope: inspect dirty state in `hivemind/`, `memoryOS/`, `CapabilityOS/`,
  and `GenesisOS/`; update myworld worklog with evidence and next ownership.
- intent: reduce monitor `attention` from unknown child repo dirty state by
  deciding which changes are completed AIOS work, which need repo-local tests,
  and which must remain held for owner review.
- result: all four child repos had coherent completed AIOS work and clean
  repo-local verification, so each was committed in its owning repo:
  - `hivemind` `33e08c6` — `Add L0 dispatcher debate state`
  - `memoryOS` `48f5100` — `Import AIOS memory review requests`
  - `CapabilityOS` `7303440` — `Complete AIOS capability recommendation surface`
  - `GenesisOS` `6b38a3a` — `Record GenesisOS semantic closeouts`
- verification:
  - `hivemind`: `python -m pytest tests/test_production_hardening.py -q`
    passed 37/37.
  - `memoryOS`: `python -m pytest tests/test_drafts_cli.py
    tests/test_doctor.py -q` passed 69/69.
  - `CapabilityOS`: `python -m pytest -q` passed 21/21.
  - `GenesisOS`: `python -m pytest tests -q` passed 48/48.
  - `git diff --check` passed for all four child repos before commit.
  - focused secret/PIN scan over changed files found no provider PIN or API key
    values; `BROWSER_TOKEN` appeared only as a test fixture string.
- evidence: live `python scripts/aios_monitor.py snapshot --json` now reports
  no alerts; child watcher status remains pending=0 for all four repos.
- next: parent `myworld` still has tracked control-plane changes and child
  repo gitlink updates; commit only a scoped myworld batch after final
  verification because unrelated AIOS work is also present in the worktree.
- boundary: do not revert or overwrite child repo changes; do not touch
  secrets, raw exports, provider auth, or private history.

## 2026-05-16 13:34 KST — codex — ASC-0180 Genesis assumption repair

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0180-hive-debate-aios-hosting-trust-model.md`,
  Genesis critic verification, and worklog.
- intent: address GenesisOS `assumption-silent` advisory by making the hosting
  debate's hidden assumptions explicit and negatable without changing
  deployment authority or scope.
- result: added `Assumptions To Negate` to ASC-0180 with six explicit
  assumptions and negations covering non-localhost necessity, hosted-ingest
  boundary, root-of-trust topology, emit-only privacy, reversibility, and
  founder verdict authority.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py --limit 1 --json`
  scanned ASC-0180 with `flagged_count=0`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_genesis_critic_dispatch -v`
  passed 2/2; `git diff --check` passed for the contract and worklog.
- next: refresh monitor assessment; the remaining advisory should be the
  persona-axis score, not prompt-prison on ASC-0180.
- boundary: no hosting code, deployment config, credentials, or uri changes.

## 2026-05-16 03:18 KST — codex — Gate Chair runtime candidate config

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json`, tests, docs, and worklog.
- intent: move Gate Chair runtime selection from hidden environment variables
  toward an AIOS-owned runtime candidate file that Control Center can observe
  and the chat router can honor.
- result: added `aios.gate.chair_runtime.v1` support. The router now honors
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json` for
  `internal_evidence_synthesizer` and `ollama` modes, and the config itself can
  enable Gate Chair synthesis. The snapshot now exposes `runtime_config` and
  `runtime_config_active` under `installation.gate_chair`.
- live_config: wrote `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json` with
  `mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer` as the explicit default until a
  non-internal Chair beats the baseline eval.
- evidence: live chat smoke for `AIOS에는 gate 역할의 Agent가 있나?` returned
  `gate_chair_status.mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer` and response text that
  cites `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json`. Live snapshot reports
  `runtime_config_active=true`, `runtime_config.mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`,
  and `detail=chair_runtime.json`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_control_snapshot tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval tests.test_aios_local_app -v`

  scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py`; `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `git diff --check` passed for the touched files.
- runtime: refreshed Control Center snapshot; server remains running on
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, websocket on `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`, and
  round controller remains running with `latest_next=hold_for_monitor`.
- next: add a controlled API/UI action to switch the candidate between internal
  and Ollama once a local model exists, then require `promotion_ready=true`
  before defaulting AIOS chat to that runtime.
- deferred: executing Codex/Claude/Gemini as Chair. Local provider CLIs exist,
  but this slice avoids triggering PIN/rate-limit paths and only introduces
  the candidate-control contract.

## 2026-05-16 03:13 KST — codex — Gate Chair promotion readiness clarity

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,

  `tests/test_aios_gate_chair_eval.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, docs,
  and this worklog.
- intent: prevent a misleading `1.0 / 1.0` eval score from implying the current
  Chair is provider-grade when it is actually the same deterministic internal
  runtime as the baseline.
- result: Gate Chair eval reports now include `promotion_ready`,
  `readiness_reason`, `current_runtime_external`, and `current_runtime_modes`.
  The Control Center `Eval Chair` status now starts with `promotion ready` or
  `not ready`, then shows verdict/scores and the readiness reason before the
  report artifact.
- evidence: CLI eval wrote `eval_id=bcc1082a090d717f` with
  `promotion_ready=false`, `current_runtime_external=false`, and
  `readiness_reason=current Chair uses the internal deterministic runtime`.
  Live HTTP `/api/gate_chair_eval` after server restart returned the same fields
  with `eval_id=0a3c7e48fc5a6504`.

  `.aios/screenshots/control-gate-chair-promotion-ready.png`.
- runtime: Control Center restarted again and is running on
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`; websocket is running on
  `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`.
- next: route a real Chair candidate, then require `promotion_ready=true`
  before calling it the AIOS conversational front door.
- deferred: wiring a provider-backed Chair. This slice adds the readiness gate
  that will judge that wiring later.

## 2026-05-16 14:06 KST — codex — Provider CLI Chair candidate modes

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `scripts/aios_local_app.py`,
  `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, Control Center runtime buttons, tests,
  and docs.
- intent: let AIOS evaluate provider CLI substrates as Gate Chair candidates
  instead of being stuck with `internal_evidence_synthesizer` or Ollama only.
- result: `chair_runtime.json` now accepts whitelisted `claude`, `codex`, and
  `gemini` modes in addition to `internal_evidence_synthesizer` and `ollama`.
  The router turns those modes into bounded provider Chair commands, the local
  app API stores only mode/model metadata, the snapshot reports provider
  command availability, and the Runtime band exposes `Try Claude`, `Try Codex`,
  and `Try Gemini`.
- evidence: unit tests use fake provider CLI binaries to prove a configured
  provider Chair can synthesize a chat answer without arbitrary shell storage.
  Live API smoke accepted `mode=claude` with `command_available=true`; the
  runtime was restored to `internal_evidence_synthesizer` immediately after the
  smoke.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router
  tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot

  scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`; `git diff --check` passed for touched
  files.
- visual smoke: Firefox headless captured
  `.aios/screenshots/control-gate-provider-chair-buttons.png` and confirmed the
  new provider Chair candidate buttons render in the Runtime band.
- runtime: Control Center was restarted so `/api/gate_chair_runtime` serves the
  new allowed modes. It is running at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, websocket at
  `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`.
- boundary: store only whitelisted runtime mode names and optional model names.
  Do not store provider secrets, PINs, arbitrary shell commands, or auth files.

## 2026-05-17 11:39 KST — codex — Gate Chair eval negative evidence absorption

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: Gate Chair eval can observe provider timeouts/backpressure, but
  those failures currently stay in `.aios/evals/gate_chair/*/report.json`.
  The next AIOS chat route cannot reuse them as negative provider evidence.
- intent: make recent Gate Chair eval failures available to the chat Gate's
  fallback negative-evidence projection without auto-promoting them into
  accepted MemoryOS records.
- result: `local_negative_evidence()` now scans recent Gate Chair eval reports
  and projects failed `gate_chair_status` rows, such as `gate_chair_timeout`,
  as temporary local negative evidence. These rows keep their report provenance
  and remain `aios_receipts`, not accepted MemoryOS records.
- evidence: live `python scripts/aios_chat.py --message 'provider 실패 기억은?'
  --conversation negative-gate-chair-live-smoke --json` returned
  `negative_evidence_source=aios_receipts` with two
  `gate_chair_timeout` rows from
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/177e8627e75a4e6e/report.json`; the same turn's
  `capability_route_audit.bad_provider_signals.claude` included those timeout
  rows.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router -v` passed

  scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`; `git diff
  --check` passed for the touched files.
- next: promote these projected eval failures into reviewed MemoryOS memories
  only through the memory review flow; do not let temporary receipt evidence
  become permanent routing truth without review.

## 2026-05-17 11:44 KST — codex — Monitor blocker reconciliation

- status: done
- scope: `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0182.myworld.result.json`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `GenesisOS/`, `CapabilityOS/`, and monitor
  state.
- discomfort: the round controller kept holding for monitor even though
  ASC-0182 was already closed and benchmark evidence existed. The actual gap
  was a missing myworld outbox result packet plus two child-repo dirty markers.
- result: added the missing ASC-0182 myworld result packet and collected it
  with `python scripts/aios_dispatch.py collect --repo myworld`; preserved a
  misplaced CapabilityOS ledger fragment in the myworld ledger and removed the
  child-repo copy; committed the verified GenesisOS inline-text fix locally as
  `140783f Fix inline text handling for Genesis CLI`.
- evidence: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_paper -v` passed 9/9;
  GenesisOS `python -m pytest -q` passed 49/49; `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` now reports `health=watch` and
  `watched.alerts=0`; `python scripts/aios_local_app.py status --json
  --assert-live` reports `monitor_health=clear`.
- next: let the round controller advance from `hold_for_monitor` on the next
  pass, then continue with the remaining advisory Genesis/persona signals
  rather than treating them as blockers.

## 2026-05-17 11:36 KST — codex — Gate Chair candidate eval and runtime labeling

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, and Gate Chair eval/runtime artifacts.
- discomfort: AIOS chat had a real Gate/Chair layer, but the active Chair was
  still deterministic. A Claude provider Chair candidate existed, yet using it
  directly would risk ordinary chat inheriting provider timeouts. During eval,
  candidate-runtime wording also made the candidate look like the active
  `chair_runtime.json`.
- result: `gate_chair_runtime_summary()` now names
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_candidate_runtime.json` as a `candidate override`
  when `AIOS_GATE_CHAIR_RUNTIME_PATH` is used, instead of implying the active
  runtime changed. Added a regression test for this candidate/active labeling.
- evidence: `python scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py --mode both --json` wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/177e8627e75a4e6e/report.json` with
  `current_runtime_modes=["claude"]`, `scores.internal=1.0`,
  `scores.current=0.875`, `promotion_ready=false`, and
  `verdict=current_runtime_worse_than_internal`. The Claude candidate succeeded
  on two prompts and timed out on two prompts, so it correctly stayed
  quarantined rather than becoming the active AIOS chat Chair. A live
  `/api/chat` smoke for the Gate question returned
  `gate_chair_status.mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer` and explicitly named
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json (active runtime)` as the deterministic
  Chair.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router

- runtime: Control Center was restarted after the runtime-label fix and remains
  live at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`; websocket is live at
  `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`; round controller is still running.
- next: keep the internal Chair active until a provider/local Chair beats the
  baseline without timeout. Treat provider Chair timeout as negative evidence
  for CapabilityOS/Hive routing rather than a reason to promote the candidate.

## 2026-05-16 14:17 KST — codex — Gate Chair promotion endpoint

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`, tests, and docs.
- intent: close the runtime lifecycle from candidate to eval to active
  promotion, without allowing provider candidates to become active merely
  because a user clicked `Try`.
- result: added `POST /api/gate_chair_promote` and a `Promote Chair` Control
  Center action that appears only after `Eval Chair` returns a
  `promotion_ready=true` report. Provider Chair candidates remain quarantined
  in `.aios/gate/founder/chair_candidate_runtime.json` until an explicit
  confirmed promotion writes the active runtime file.
- evidence: live HTTP smoke against `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` rejected
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/bcc1082a090d717f/report.json` with
  `reason=promotion_not_ready`, and rejected an unconfirmed promotion with

  `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`; round controller is still running.
- boundary: promotion must require explicit confirmation and a
  `promotion_ready=true` eval report. No secrets, PINs, or arbitrary provider
  commands may enter runtime config.

## 2026-05-16 14:14 KST — codex — Gate Chair candidate quarantine before activation

  `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `apps/control/app.js`, tests, and docs.
- discomfort: the `Try Claude/Codex/Gemini/Ollama` buttons could make a
  provider Chair active before it passed eval. That contradicted the Gate
  promotion rule and could trigger provider CLI backpressure during ordinary
  chat.
- result: provider-like Chair modes now write
  `.aios/gate/founder/chair_candidate_runtime.json` with `status=candidate` by
  default. Normal chat still reads only the active `chair_runtime.json`.
  `scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py` can explicitly evaluate the candidate via
  `AIOS_GATE_CHAIR_RUNTIME_PATH` override without activating it.
- evidence: live API smoke for `mode=claude` returned
  `runtime_config_path=.aios/gate/founder/chair_candidate_runtime.json` and
  `activation_required=true`. A follow-up `/api/chat` architecture turn still
  reported `gate_chair_status.mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`, proving the
  candidate did not hijack normal chat.

  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: respond to the founder's observation that the Control Center chat
  still feels like system receipts, even though the router now has a Gate/Chair
  layer. Keep AIOS evidence available, but make the primary user experience a
  direct conversation.
- result: inline Control Center chat and standalone `chat.html` now show a
  simple answer bubble first. Substrate/cost/artifact detail is reduced to a
  compact `AIOS Gate · Chair ... · MemoryOS ...` meta line and a collapsed
  `Trace` block. The first assistant message and input placeholder were also
  simplified.
- evidence: live HTTP `/api/chat` for `나에 대한 기억은 ?` returns MemoryOS
  memory content in `response`, with `gate_chair_status.mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`.
  This confirms the Gate exists, but current Chair quality is still
  deterministic evidence synthesis rather than a provider-grade LLM runtime.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js && node --check

  Control Center is still running at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`, websocket at
  `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`, and the round controller remains running.
- boundary: no provider credentials, PINs, or runtime secrets were changed.
  Current Chair remains deterministic until a non-internal runtime passes the
  Gate Chair eval.

  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: make the Gate Chair quality loop visible and runnable from the end
  user Control Center instead of leaving it as a CLI-only artifact.
- result: added `POST /api/gate_chair_eval` and an `Eval Chair` Runtime-band
  action. The UI shows eval verdict/scores and exposes the generated report
  through the same read-only artifact preview control used elsewhere.
- evidence: live HTTP `POST /api/gate_chair_eval` wrote

  `verdict=tie_or_no_external_delta`, `scores.internal=1.0`, and
  `scores.current=1.0`. The result confirms current Chair is still equivalent
  to the deterministic internal runtime, not a better provider-backed Chair.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval tests.test_aios_chat_router -v`
  passed 43/43; `node --check apps/control/app.js`; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py
  scripts/aios_chat_router.py`; `git diff --check` passed for touched files.
  Visual smoke captured `.aios/screenshots/control-gate-chair-eval-styled.png`
  from `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` and confirmed the styled `Eval Chair` control
  renders in the Runtime band.
- runtime: Control Center restarted and is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`;
  websocket is running on `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`.
- next: attach or route a real Chair runtime candidate, then use this eval
  surface as the promotion gate before treating it as the AIOS conversational
  front door.
- deferred: selecting a new Chair model or changing provider credentials. This
  slice only exposes the evaluation surface and report artifact.

## 2026-05-17 14:30 KST — codex — Gate Chair privacy and provider-backed smoke

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0188-gate-chair-conversational-activation-policy.md`,
  and this worklog.
- intent: answer whether AIOS chat has a real Gate/Chair Agent or only system
  templates, while preventing provider prompts, command argv, PINs, keys, or
  private context from leaking into AIOS artifacts.
- result: Gate Chair prompts are compacted before provider execution, response
  text is redacted before persistence, prompt previews are redacted, and
  provider/chair execution metadata now stores command receipts as executable
  plus `[REDACTED_COMMAND_ARGS]` or `[REDACTED_COMMAND]`.
- evidence: live current eval wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/78ebcc65c91c076c/report.json` with
  `chosen_substrate=aios_gate`, `gate_chair_status.mode=claude`,
  `gate_chair_status.model=claude-opus-4-6`, `score=1.0`, and
  `current_failure_count=0`.
- promotion: both-mode eval wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/d43d018641cbb600/report.json` with
  `promotion_ready=true`, `scores.current=1.0`, `scores.internal=1.0`,
  `current_failure_count=0`, and current runtime mode `claude`. The Control
  Center promotion API then activated `.aios/gate/founder/chair_runtime.json`
  as `mode=claude`, `model=claude-opus-4-6`.
- production smoke: `python scripts/aios_chat.py --conversation
  gate-chair-active-smoke --message 'AIOS에는 gate 역할의 Agent가 있나? 아니면
  시스템 답변밖에 못하나?' --json` returned `chosen_substrate=aios_gate` and
  `gate_chair_status.status=success` with active `mode=claude`.
- privacy receipt:
  `.aios/chat/gate-chair-eval-78ebcc65c91c076c-current-1/gate_chair_turns.jsonl`
  stores `chair_meta.command` as `["claude", "[REDACTED_COMMAND_ARGS]"]`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router
  tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval tests.test_aios_local_app -v` passed 74/74;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py
  scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`; `git diff
  --check -- scripts/aios_chat_router.py tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`;
  and focused Gate Chair output redaction test passed.
- next: make the Chat UI show the active Chair runtime and "system template vs
  provider Chair" status directly beside each answer, so end users can see
  when the Gate is using MemoryOS/CapabilityOS/GenesisOS evidence and which
  provider synthesized the response.

## 2026-05-17 14:39 KST — codex — Chat runtime strip for visible AIOS routing

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: remove the UX gap where AIOS answers could be provider-backed but
  still look like plain system text because Chair/Memory/Capability/Genesis
  evidence was hidden inside the collapsed trace.
- result: standalone `chat.html` and the Control Center inline chat now render
  a compact runtime strip under assistant answers. The strip shows `Chair`,
  `Memory`, `Capability`, `Genesis`, and `Route` status before the full
  artifact trace.
- visual evidence: Playwright opened `http://127.0.0.1:8765/chat.html`, sent
  `AIOS에는 gate 역할의 Agent가 있나? 한 문장으로 답해줘`, waited for
  `.chat-message.assistant .chat-runtime-strip`, and saved
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-runtime-strip-playwright.png`. The observed
  strip contained `Chair claude claude-opus-4-6`, a MemoryOS `rtrace`, a
  CapabilityOS route artifact, `Genesis 5 branches`, and
  `Route aios_gate / gate_answer`.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/chat.js`; `node --check
  apps/control/app.js`; `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app
  tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed 37/37; `git diff --check` passed
  for touched files. The legacy Firefox visual verifier still degraded with
  `browser_timeout`, so Playwright is the stronger visual receipt for this
  slice.
- next: add the same runtime strip summary to exported chat artifacts or
  message history views, so old conversations can be scanned without opening
  each trace.

## 2026-05-17 14:45 KST — codex — Chat history runtime scanner

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/chat.html`,
  `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this
  worklog.
- intent: remove the UX gap where AIOS answers became visible only in the live
  turn, while old conversations required manually opening `.aios/chat/*`
  artifacts to see whether a provider Chair, MemoryOS trace, or route was used.
- result: added `GET /api/chat_history`, which scans `.aios/chat/*` and returns
  redacted conversation previews, route metadata, Chair runtime status, message
  counts, and safe artifact refs. The standalone `chat.html` page now renders a
  `Recent Conversations` panel with runtime chips and artifact shortcuts; card
  clicks select the conversation id for continuation.
- privacy: preview text is redacted for emails, PINs, API keys, and token-like
  values before it leaves the API. Full artifacts remain behind the existing
  `/api/artifact` allowlist.
- evidence: live `curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/chat_history` returned
  `aios.chat.history.v1` with active `claude-opus-4-6` Chair metadata for
  recent turns. Playwright opened `http://127.0.0.1:8765/chat.html`, waited for
  `.chat-history-card`, observed 12 cards, and saved
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-history-runtime.png`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js`; `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v` passed 38/38;
  `git diff --check` passed for touched files.
- next: add filter tabs for `provider Chair`, `internal`, `MemoryOS review
  needed`, and `failed provider` so the founder can scan for weak loops instead
  of only recent activity.

## 2026-05-17 21:18 KST — codex — Completion claim downgraded to readiness audit

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- reference: `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-ui-reference-before.png`.
- discomfort: the first-screen Control Center showed `AIOS COMPLETE — fully
  sovereign and self-maintaining` while live status still said attention and
  child-repo owner review could remain. That makes the UI overclaim completion
  and weakens trust.
- result: the Completion band now presents as `Readiness Audit`. It uses
  monitor findings and child repo dirty flags as active blockers, prepends a
  `Do not declare complete yet` review card when needed, and only displays
  completion criteria as audit evidence instead of final truth. The inline chat
  thread was also reduced from a fixed tall blank pane to a compact content
  surface so the first viewport shows the audit state without scrolling.
  Blockers are now rendered as separate severity/owner/action rows instead of
  one long sentence, making the next owner and next action visible at a glance.
  Mobile navigation now collapses into a compact horizontal rail so the
  conversation and readiness audit appear before a long menu stack.
- next: keep turning raw OS state into product-visible evidence surfaces, with
  visual screenshots before and after each UI change.

## 2026-05-17 21:26 KST — codex — OS Observatory signal bars

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/design/AIOS_PROVIDER_WEB_REFERENCES.md`,
  and this worklog.
- reference: `.aios/screenshots/aios-os-observatory-reference-before.png`.
- discomfort: the OS Observatory showed counts but not whether each OS was
  useful, weak, or waiting. A user could see MemoryOS node volume without seeing
  retrieval selectivity, or Hive dispatch volume without execution proof.
- result: each OS lane now shows a visual signal bar derived from existing
  evidence: MemoryOS retrieval selectivity, CapabilityOS route coverage,
  GenesisOS divergence width, Hive execution proof, and MyWorld control
  readiness. The bars are not completion claims; they expose where the loop is
  strong or weak. A provider web reference board was added so AIOS UI work can
  borrow deliberately from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity instead of
  inventing isolated screens from memory.
- next: connect weak signal bars to one-click evidence views and route/fix
  actions instead of making the user infer the next step from logs.

## 2026-05-17 21:33 KST — codex — Chat Evidence Desk

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- reference: `docs/design/AIOS_PROVIDER_WEB_REFERENCES.md` and the Claude
  Artifacts pattern: substantial work output should live beside chat, not only
  inside the message stream.
- discomfort: AIOS chat already produced receipts, memory packs, route files,
  screenshots, and contracts, but opening them used a floating hash panel. It
  felt like a debug overlay rather than a stable artifact workspace.
- result: `chat.html` now has a persistent `Evidence Desk` pane. Artifact links,
  visual verification receipts, route previews, and hash-restored artifacts open
  into that pane while preserving the existing fallback floating panel path for
  non-chat contexts. The pane now renders a typed summary card above raw
  preview text, including artifact kind, status, authority, key facts, and next
  action. It also exposes `Ask About This` and `Copy Path` controls so an
  artifact can be reused as the next chat context without manually copying raw
  paths out of JSON.
- evidence: Playwright opened `http://127.0.0.1:8765/chat.html`, clicked
  `Verify`, loaded `.aios/visual_verification/vis-8025bfad43d3/receipt.json`
  into the Evidence Desk, and saved
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-evidence-desk-after.png` and
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-typed-artifact-summary-fixed.png`.
- next: turn Evidence Desk artifacts into typed cards with status, authority,
  source route, and next available action instead of raw JSON preview only.

  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this
  worklog.
- intent: make the chat history scanner useful for AIOS self-improvement, not
  just recency browsing. The discomfort was that weak loops were still buried
  inside recent activity.
- result: `GET /api/chat_history` now adds server-side `flags`, `counts`,
  `memory_review_decisions`, and `provider_failure_statuses`. The standalone
  chat page exposes filter buttons for `All`, `Provider Chair`, `Internal`,
  `Memory Review`, and `Failed Provider`.
- evidence: live API returned `counts={all:23, provider_chair:15,
  internal:8, memory_review_needed:0, failed_provider:1}`. Playwright clicked
  `Failed Provider` and observed one card:
  `gate-chair-eval-0e5c3debdf207a41-current-3` with
  `gate_chair_timeout`; clicking `Internal` showed 8 cards. Screenshot saved to
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-chat-history-filters.png`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py`;
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js`; `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`
  passed 38/38; `git diff --check` passed for touched files.
- next: connect `failed_provider` and `memory_review_needed` cards to one-click
  MemoryOS evidence review / CapabilityOS fallback recommendation packets.

## 2026-05-16 03:03 KST — codex — Gate Chair runtime clarity slice

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_chat_router.py`, `tests/test_aios_chat_router.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CHAT.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: answer the founder's complaint that AIOS chat still looks like a
  system receipt by making Gate/Chair architecture answers explicitly state
  whether the current Chair is an LLM-backed runtime or the internal evidence
  synthesizer.
- result: Gate architecture answers now include the current Gate Chair runtime
  summary. On this machine the live answer reports
  `internal_evidence_synthesizer` because no `AIOS_GATE_AGENT_COMMAND` or local
  Ollama Chair runtime is connected.
- eval: added `scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`, `AIOS_GATE_CHAIR_FORCE_INTERNAL`,
  and `tests/test_aios_gate_chair_eval.py`. The eval writes
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/<eval_id>/report.json` and compares the deterministic
  internal Chair baseline with the currently configured Chair runtime.
- evidence: CLI smoke for `AIOS에는 gate 역할의 Agent가 있나?` returned
  `chosen_substrate=aios_gate`, `gate_chair_status.mode=internal_evidence_synthesizer`,
  and a conversational response explaining the runtime gap. HTTP `/api/chat`
  smoke returned the same response through the running Control Center. Live
  `python scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py --mode both --json` wrote
  `.aios/evals/gate_chair/5bed1fad6cf21b8d/report.json` with
  `verdict=tie_or_no_external_delta`; current Chair is still the internal
  deterministic runtime.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_chat_router.py scripts/aios_chat.py`;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_gate_chair_eval.py`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router tests.test_aios_gate_chair_eval -v`
  passed 24/24;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`
  passed 24/24; `git diff --check` passed for touched files.
- runtime: Control Center remains running on `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`,
  websocket on `ws://127.0.0.1:8766/events`, and the round controller is still
  running with `latest_status=passed`, `latest_next=hold_for_monitor`.
- next: add a Gate Chair quality/eval loop so AIOS can compare the deterministic
  Chair against an attached local/provider Chair and stop treating "connected"
  as equivalent to "good conversation".
- deferred: attaching a new provider runtime or changing credentials/PIN
  handling. This slice only improves truthful Gate behavior and verification.

## 2026-05-17 22:05 KST — codex — Memory Library visual surface

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- intent: apply large provider web UI reference patterns to AIOS by giving
  MemoryOS a browsable Library surface instead of only a draft/review queue.
- result: added a `Memory Library` section and navigation target that visualizes
  MemoryOS object count, accepted/draft/rejected review mix, retrieval
  selectivity, provenance density, graph nodes, sources, and hyperedges from
  the existing `os_observatory.memory` snapshot.
- design note: this follows the provider pattern of chat-first operation with a
  persistent library/artifact pane: the end user can now see what AIOS remembers
  before inspecting lower-level draft artifacts.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`

- intent: continue provider-grade UI evolution by turning CapabilityOS from a
  backend route record into a visible tool/search/provider router surface.
- result: added a `Capability Router` section and navigation target that
  visualizes catalog card count, observations, gaps, result files, route
  coverage, gap pressure, local vs web route status, and the current
  top-route shortlist from `os_observatory.capability`.
- design note: this follows search-provider patterns: route choice, source
  mode, risk, and fallback evidence should be visible before dispatch instead
  of hidden in raw JSON artifacts.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`
  passed 42/42; `git diff --check` passed for touched files. Playwright

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- intent: make the founder's GenesisOS definition visible in the UI: GenesisOS
  is the OS that notices discomfort, turns it into a need hypothesis, and emits
  invention/contract seeds without claiming execution authority.
- result: added a `genesis-cycle-grid` above worldline branches that summarizes
  Discomfort, Need, and Invention seed directly from `what_it_breaks`,
  `why_it_might_matter`, and `contract_seed` in the current GenesisOS branch
  artifact.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;

## 2026-05-17 22:39 KST — codex — Route and branch chat handoff controls

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- intent: move the new CapabilityOS and GenesisOS visual surfaces from passive
  observability toward an AIOS control surface without bypassing governance.
- result: added reusable inline chat handoff controls. Capability route rows now
  prepare an `Ask AIOS` prompt with route id, score, risk, network requirement,
  and observation count. Genesis invention seeds and branch cards now prepare
  `Develop Seed` / `Use Branch` prompts that ask AIOS to turn the speculative
  branch into a goal, contract, and verification gate.
- boundary: these controls do not execute dispatches directly. They hand the
  selected route/branch to the Gate chat so MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS,
  and Hive can still participate before execution.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`
  passed 42/42; `git diff --check` passed for touched files. Playwright
  click-through wrote `.aios/screenshots/aios-capability-route-chat-handoff.png`

  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, and this worklog.
- intent: follow the founder instruction to stop incremental local styling and
  use image-first app design. Generated an AIOS app board with ImageGen, copied
  the selected reference to
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-reference-board-control-center.png`, and used it as
  the design target for a Control Center redesign pass.
- result: renamed the app surface from TUI to Control Center, tightened the
  left navigation shell, restyled the top system status area, widened the
  chat-first command center, and added a first-screen `Evidence Desk` that
  summarizes contracts, dispatches, accepted memory, capability routes,
  Genesis branches, latest invocation artifacts, and latest dispatch receipts.
- design note: this moves the UI toward the provider-grade board pattern:
  chat/goal input stays primary, while proof, receipts, artifacts, and OS state
  are visible beside the conversation instead of buried lower on the page.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`

- intent: continue the image-board redesign by making agent execution visible
  immediately after the chat/evidence command center instead of burying it
  below OS diagnostics.
- result: moved `Agent Work` directly under the first-screen command center and
  added role progress bars for GenesisOS, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, Hive, and the
  executor. Restyled agent cards, artifact lane cards, and timeline rows toward
  the generated reference board's dense work-console pattern.
- design note: this makes the core AIOS claim visible in the first scroll:
  user goal -> OS roles -> artifacts -> dispatch timeline.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;

- intent: continue the reference-board redesign by making MemoryOS feel like a
  visual retriever and ontology store, not only aggregate count cards.
- result: upgraded Memory Library with a compact graph-map visualization,
  review/retrieval gauges, latest `context_pack.md` trace evidence, selected
  memory id extraction, latest memory request provenance, and artifact open
  controls. The graph uses existing MemoryOS aggregate counts and latest
  invocation artifacts; it does not invent accepted memories or traces.
- design note: this makes the founder's MemoryOS framing visible: memory as
  retriever + ontology + provenance, with failure/negative review still routed
  through the draft queue below.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;

- intent: continue the provider-grade cockpit redesign by making CapabilityOS
  show not only "best route" but also source mode choice and bad-tool avoidance.
- result: added source-mode chips for Internal, Web, API, MCP, and Connector;
  added gap-pressure action rows for avoid/resolve/escalate; added `Review
  Gaps` and `Choose Source` handoff buttons that prepare AIOS chat prompts
  without directly dispatching or executing tools. The capability route artifact
  can now be opened from the source panel.
- design note: this reflects CapabilityOS as a router that can say "do not use
  this tool yet" and can require operator confirmation for paid, private,
  credentialed, or destructive routes.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;

- intent: close the image-board redesign pass by removing rough first-screen
  UI artifacts that made the Evidence Desk look less like a provider-grade app.
- result: shortened Evidence Desk metric labels and changed the metric grid
  from a compressed 5-column row to a calmer 3-column layout. The first screen
  now reads as chat + evidence console instead of a log dashboard.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app tests.test_aios_control_snapshot -v`
  passed 42/42; `git diff --check` passed for touched files. Firefox visual
  verifier loaded the page but timed out on screenshot capture, so visual
  evidence was captured through the existing Playwright dependency in
  `uri/node_modules`: `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-center-redesign-desktop-final.png`
  and `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-center-redesign-mobile-final.png` both
  reported no console errors and no horizontal overflow.

## 2026-05-17 22:54 KST — codex — Visual verifier browser fallback

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_visual_verify.py`, `tests/test_aios_visual_verify.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshots, receipts, and this worklog.
- intent: convert the repeated Firefox screenshot timeout from manual operator
  friction into an AIOS primitive. CapabilityOS already recommends browser
  visual verification, but MyWorld still had a single-browser capture path.
- result: the visual verifier now keeps the requested browser as the primary
  attempt and automatically falls back through Chromium/Chrome and cached
  Playwright Chromium headless shell. Receipts preserve every attempt, mark
  `fallback_used` when a secondary browser succeeds, and emit
  `browser_fallback_exhausted` when all attempts fail.
- dogfood: `python scripts/aios_visual_verify.py http://127.0.0.1:8765/ --timeout 5 --window-size 390,844 --screenshot .aios/screenshots/aios-visual-fallback-mobile.png --require-screenshot --json`
  passed. The receipt `.aios/visual_verification/vis-cd52848d1b54/receipt.json`
  shows Firefox timed out, PATH Chromium/Chrome were unavailable, and cached
  Playwright Chromium captured `.aios/screenshots/aios-visual-fallback-mobile.png`.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_visual_verify -v` passed
  5/5; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_visual_verify.py tests/test_aios_visual_verify.py`
  passed; the fallback screenshot was visually inspected.

## 2026-05-17 23:00 KST — codex — ASC-0190 child dirty closeout

- status: done
- scope: `hivemind` verification/commit triage, ASC-0190 closeout,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0190-hivemind-verification-autofire.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: clear the live monitor blocker without overwriting child work. The
  `hivemind` repo was dirty after ASC-0190-r2 passed, so AIOS needed to decide
  whether it was failed residue, user work, or verified implementation.
- result: classified the diff as ASC-0190 provider-loop verification auto-fire,
  ran the focused and full Hive test gates, committed the child repo at
  `df897d6 Close ASC-0190 provider verification auto-fire`, and closed
  ASC-0190 in myworld with evidence.
- verification: `cd hivemind && python -m pytest tests/test_provider_loop.py tests/test_aios_packet_runner.py tests/test_run_validation.py -q`
  passed 30/30; `cd hivemind && python -m pytest -q` passed 404/404;
  `cd hivemind && git diff --check` passed before commit. After commit,
  `python scripts/aios_local_app.py status --json` reported
  `monitor_health: clear`.

## 2026-05-17 23:08 KST — codex — ASC-0193 live quality-gate closeout

  `docs/contracts/ASC-0193-chat-tier2-quality-gate.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, generated chat receipts, and this worklog.
- intent: close ASC-0193 with real local-model evidence instead of relying only
  on deterministic tests. The dogfood prompt intentionally forced a weak cheap
  response so the tier-2 path had to prove itself.
- result: `asc-0193-live-smoke-clean-v2` routed through `ollama_qwen`,
  received `Done.` from `AIOS_LOCAL_AGENT_COMMAND`, escalated once to
  `qwen3:30b-a3b`, and returned `quality_gate.verdict=escalated_pass` in the
  user envelope. The same dogfood exposed local model terminal-control and
  thinking-block leakage, so provider-output sanitization now applies cursor
  erase semantics, strips ANSI/control bytes, removes the leading thinking
  block, and reflows soft-wrapped output.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_chat_router.Tier2QualityGateTest -v`
  passed 7/7; live artifacts include
  `.aios/chat/asc-0193-live-smoke-clean-v2/messages.jsonl`,
  `.aios/chat/asc-0193-live-smoke-clean-v2/quality_gate.jsonl`, and

## 2026-05-17 23:18 KST — codex — ASC-0191 GenesisOS generative divergence

- status: done
- scope: `GenesisOS` child repo, `docs/contracts/ASC-0191-genesisos-generative-divergence.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: address the deepest persona-audit gap: GenesisOS was only a
  deterministic scaffold. The target was local, opt-in generation with
  advisory-only authority and deterministic fallback intact.
- result: GenesisOS commit `5a935b1 Add local generative divergence helper`
  adds `genesisos/generator.py`, optional `--generated` support for `diverge`,
  `critic`, and `analogy match`, fake-helper tests, unavailable-helper fallback
  tests, and local output sanitization. ASC-0191 is closed as local-helper only;
  remote generation remains out of scope.
- dogfood: `GENESISOS_OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3:8b python -m genesisos.cli diverge --goal "AIOS agents keep converging on contracts and dashboards instead of inventing a new interaction ritual" --generated --json`
  produced five generated branch augmentations with
  `generation_policy=local_helper_optional_with_heuristic_fallback`.
- verification: `cd GenesisOS && python -m pytest tests -q` passed 55/55;
  `cd GenesisOS && git diff --check` passed before commit.

## 2026-05-17 23:25 KST — codex — Control Center Evidence Desk polish

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`, visual receipts,
  and this worklog.
- intent: use the generated/reference-driven UI workflow on the live app and
  fix the immediately visible end-user discomfort: artifact receipt cards were
  wrapping long paths and machine labels into unreadable fragments.
- result: the command Evidence Desk now separates artifact label, status, path,
  and open/copy controls. Long receipt paths stay inspectable via title/copy
  actions while the card remains scannable.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed;
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface tests.test_aios_control_snapshot.AiosControlSnapshotTest.test_snapshot_contains_control_plane_sections -v`

  `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshots, and this worklog.
- intent: address the MemoryOS weakness exposed by the persona audit and by
  founder feedback: users could see memory counts, but not which memories were
  selected, why they were selected, or what provenance paths backed them.
- GenesisOS critique: local `qwen3:8b` generated an advisory warning that
  dynamic/probabilistic memory trails can overload users unless the UI makes
  the distinction between selected traces and fixed facts clear.
- result: the control snapshot now resolves recent `retrieval_traces.jsonl`
  rows against MemoryOS memory objects and sources. The Memory Library UI shows
  trace id, query, signal coverage, selected count, selected memory previews,
  confidence, evidence state, and source/provenance path.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`
  passed; `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed; Playwright captured
  `.aios/screenshots/aios-memoryos-retrieval-board-section-v2.png` after
  scrolling to the operator Memory Library, with no console errors.

## 2026-05-17 23:45 KST — codex — CapabilityOS search cockpit surfaced

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshots, and this
  worklog.
- intent: make CapabilityOS visible as a router for local, provider, web, API,
  MCP, and skill/plugin choices instead of a shallow card counter. The
  discomfort was that AIOS said "use CapabilityOS" while the end-user UI did
  not show what CapabilityOS would actually route or block.
- result: the snapshot now absorbs CapabilityOS `observe-results`,
  `provider-route`, `web-route`, and `constraint-break` outputs. The Control
  Center shows source-mode buckets, provider fallback scores, gap samples, web
  evidence steps, permission questions, and stop conditions while preserving
  recommendation-only authority.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py` and
  `node --check apps/control/app.js` passed; focused snapshot tests passed;
  Playwright captured `.aios/screenshots/aios-capabilityos-search-cockpit.png`
  and `.aios/screenshots/aios-capabilityos-web-policy-v2.png` with no
  horizontal overflow.

## 2026-05-17 23:56 KST — codex — Control Center dark visual reboot

- scope: `apps/control/styles.css`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`,
  `docs/design/AIOS_CONTROL_CENTER_REFERENCE_BOARD.md`, generated reference
  board, visual receipts, and this worklog.
- intent: follow the visual-first UI workflow requested by the founder: create
  an image reference board, then use it to make the end-user Control Center
  feel like a provider-grade AIOS app rather than a plain log dashboard.
- result: preserved the existing app structure but replaced the visual shell
  with a dark chat-first console, stronger Evidence Desk treatment, semantic
  OS colors, compact route/proof cards, and mobile one-column behavior.
- reference: `.aios/screenshots/aios-control-center-reference-board-v2.png`.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`,
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py scripts/aios_local_app.py`,

## 2026-05-17 23:59 KST — codex — First-screen Live OS Route

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshots, and this worklog.
- intent: remove a UX ambiguity from the new Control Center: the user could
  see chat and receipts, but the provider-style first viewport did not yet show
  the actual AIOS route through Gate, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS, GenesisOS, Hive,
  and Proofs.
- result: the Evidence Desk now renders a `Live OS Route` rail with route step
  state and compact evidence counts. It uses existing snapshot evidence rather
  than inventing a new execution claim.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`,
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`,
  and `git diff --check -- apps/control/app.js apps/control/styles.css`

## 2026-05-18 00:04 KST — codex — GenesisOS critique to Intent Lens

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshots, and this
  worklog.
- GenesisOS critique: local `qwen3:8b` advisory critic said the dark
  chat-first UI still risked contextual ambiguity and raw evidence overload;
  the need was predictive contextual cues rather than more logs.
- result: added a first-screen `Intent Lens` below quick actions. It displays
  inferred intent, next owner, and context capacity from existing monitor and
  OS observatory evidence, without claiming new execution.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`,
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`,
  and `git diff --check -- apps/control/index.html apps/control/app.js apps/control/styles.css`

## 2026-05-18 00:39 KST — codex — ASC-0195 MemoryOS fallback blocker closed

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0195-memoryos-embed-fallback-hermetic-tests.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, MemoryOS result packet, and this worklog.
- intent: do not leave ASC-0194 stuck on an environment-coupled full test
  gate. The uncomfortable finding was that "Ollama absent" tests were really
  "whatever this machine happens to expose at 127.0.0.1:11434" tests.
- result: child watcher completed MemoryOS commit `146b946 Harden embed
  fallback tests`; ASC-0195 is closed with result packet
  `.aios/outbox/memoryOS/asc-0195.memoryOS.result.json`.
- verification: worker full gate `python -m pytest -q` passed 2027 tests; the
  myworld supervisor rechecked the focused suite at 578 passed, plus
  `py_compile` and `git diff --check`.
- next: resume ASC-0194 by wiring `memory graph-control run --persist` into
  the myworld dream-cycle loop, then make MemoryOS retrieval evidence and
  GenesisOS advisory output visible in the Control Center.

## 2026-05-18 00:48 KST — codex — ASC-0194 dream-stage graph control wired

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_dream.py`, `scripts/aios_round_controller.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_dream.py`, `docs/contracts/ASC-0194-memoryos-graph-control-model.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: MemoryOS had a graph-control alpha, but AIOS's dream organ only
  embedded memory; it did not actually wake the Graph Control Model. Direct
  live smoke also showed graph-control/stats paths can be slow on the current
  ledger, so unbounded wiring would make the autonomous loop brittle.
- result: the dream organ now calls MemoryOS `memory graph-control run
  --persist --project AIOS --limit 10 --json` as a bounded stage and records
  either the persisted run summary or a degraded timeout receipt. The round
  controller now passes explicit dream budgets so graph-control cannot consume
  the whole control loop.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_dream -v` passed 4/4;
  `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_dream.py scripts/aios_round_controller.py`
  passed; short live smoke produced `memory_graph_control.status=degraded`
  with `reason=graph_control_timeout` and left no lingering child processes.
- next: MemoryOS needs incremental/performance work for large-ledger
  graph-control so ASC-0194 can close on repeatable live completion, not only
  bounded degraded behavior.

## 2026-05-18 02:09 KST — codex — Control Center visual reboot and GenesisOS action loop

- status: done

  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, `docs/design/AIOS_CONTROL_CENTER_REFERENCE_BOARD.md`,
  generated screenshots, and this worklog.
- design loop: generated the v3 app image board first, then rebuilt the first
  viewport as a provider-grade chat cockpit: left navigation, central
  conversation workbench, Intent Lens, and a right-side Evidence Desk with the
  live Gate -> Memory -> Capability -> Genesis -> Hive -> Proofs route.
- AIOS loop improvement: Control Center now exposes GenesisOS prompt-prison
  findings as actionable rows with `Break Frame` and `Propose Contract`.
  `Propose Contract` calls `/api/genesis_break_frame_seed`, writes a
  speculative seed, materializes a `status: proposed` contract, and does not
  start execution.
- dogfood: used the new API against the live Control Center to turn the
  GenesisOS advisory on `ASC-0192` into
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0198-break-genesisos-prompt-prison-frame-for-asc-0192-into-alternate-worldlines-and-a.md`.
  The generated contract is explicitly `authority: speculative_only` and its
  promotion receipt is
  `.aios/promotions/friction-bbc06575a205-20260518T020758/promotion.json`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py
  scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`, focused unittest suite, and
  `git diff --check` passed. Visual verification passed with screenshot
  `.aios/screenshots/vis-6ec2b5a166f3.png` and receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-6ec2b5a166f3/receipt.json`.
- next: review/accept or revise `ASC-0198`, then dispatch it only after
  operator acceptance; separately continue visual work on MemoryOS and
  CapabilityOS operating-state views.

## 2026-05-18 02:20 KST — codex — MemoryOS graph preview made evidence-backed

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, screenshots, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the MemoryOS graph visualization looked like a graph, but it was
  drawn from fixed decorative coordinates. That made the panel feel polished
  while still hiding the actual RetrievalTrace -> memory -> provenance chain.
- result: the snapshot now emits `os_observatory.memory.graph_preview` from
  real `retrieval_traces.jsonl`, selected memory objects, and source/provenance
  paths. The Control Center renders retrieved edges and provenance edges from
  that preview, with trace/source labels and memory-node hover details.
- operator access: Control Center now supports `?mode=operator` deep links and
  replays hash scrolling after mode selection, so operator panels can be opened
  directly for visual checks.
- evidence: live snapshot produced 19 graph nodes and 24 graph edges for the
  current MemoryOS state. DOM verification showed rendered
  `memory-graph-node`, `memory-graph-edge`, `rtrace_...`, and provenance source
  nodes inside `#memory-library`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`, focused unittest suite, and
  `git diff --check` passed. Visual receipt:
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-91af174d3d1f/receipt.json`; operator tall
  screenshot: `.aios/screenshots/aios-operator-memory-tall.png`.
- next: do the same evidence-backed treatment for CapabilityOS search routes
  and GenesisOS worldline panels, then route ASC-0198 for acceptance/revision.

## 2026-05-18 02:25 KST — codex — CapabilityOS route map made evidence-backed

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshots, and
  this worklog.
- discomfort: the Capability Router showed good summary cards, but route choice
  still required reading disconnected rows. It was not obvious which route was
  backed by source evidence, which fallback would take over, and which gaps
  should make AIOS avoid or repair a route.
- result: the snapshot now emits `os_observatory.capability.route_preview`
  from CapabilityOS recommendations, fallback ids, evidence refs, gap samples,
  and provider fallback observations. The UI renders a `Route Evidence Map`
  with route, fallback, evidence, gap, and provider nodes plus typed edges.
- evidence: live snapshot produced 20 route-preview nodes and 15 edges with
  node types `route`, `fallback`, `evidence`, `gap`, and `provider`. DOM
  verification confirmed rendered `capability-route-map`,
  `capability-route-node`, `capability-route-edge`, `Route Evidence Map`,
  `skipped_result`, and provider fallback nodes.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`, focused unittest coverage for
  `build_capability_route_preview`, and Control Center DOM/visual checks
  passed. Screenshot attempt for the deep-linked operator section exposed a
  headless hash-scroll capture quirk, so the DOM render is the stronger
  evidence for the route map while the non-hash operator visual receipt remains
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-91af174d3d1f/receipt.json`.
- next: apply the same evidence-backed approach to GenesisOS worldline panels
  and then review/accept or revise `ASC-0198`.

## 2026-05-18 02:38 KST — codex — GenesisOS worldline map made evidence-backed

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/index.html`,

  `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, refreshed Control Center snapshot assets, and
  this worklog.
- discomfort: GenesisOS could generate branch cards and contract seeds, but
  the Control Center still made users read disconnected cards to understand how
  a discomfort became a worldline and then a governed invention seed. That hid
  GenesisOS's actual role as the OS that turns discomfort into possible work.
- result: snapshot generation now emits `genesis_lens.worldline_preview` from
  the latest GenesisOS branch artifact. The UI renders a `Worldline Map` that
  connects discomfort nodes to speculative branch nodes, invention seed nodes,
  and the source Genesis artifact with typed `provokes`, `invents`, and
  `evidence` edges. Clicking a discomfort, branch, or seed prepares an AIOS
  chat turn asking for a governed goal/contract/verification gate.
- evidence: live snapshot produced 16 GenesisOS worldline nodes and 15 edges
  with node types `discomfort`, `branch`, `seed`, and `source`; edge types were
  `provokes`, `invents`, and `evidence`. DOM verification confirmed rendered
  `genesis-worldline-map`, `genesis-worldline-node`,
  `genesis-worldline-edge`, and `Worldline Map`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`, focused unittest coverage for
  `build_genesis_worldline_preview`, Control Center DOM checks, and visual
  verification passed with receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-a9a1c231cd9a/receipt.json`.
- next: review/accept or revise `ASC-0198`, then continue converting
  provider/internal runtime evidence into the same visual OS-map language so
  end users can see not just logs but why AIOS chose an action.

## 2026-05-18 02:41 KST — codex — Gate Chair runtime map made visible

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, refreshed
  Control Center snapshot assets, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the Runtime band named Gate Chair state, demotion, and recovery
  in sentence form, but users could not see how a configured provider runtime
  becomes the effective runtime or why AIOS falls back to the internal chair.
- result: snapshot generation now emits
  `installation.gate_chair.runtime_preview`. The Control Center renders a
  `Gate Runtime Map` connecting active runtime config, candidate runtime,
  effective runtime, latest turn, demotion evidence, and recovery proof with
  typed edges.
- evidence: live snapshot produced 5 runtime nodes and 4 edges with node types
  `config`, `candidate`, `effective`, `failure`, and `turn`; edge types were
  `selects`, `candidate`, `demotes`, and `produces`. DOM verification
  confirmed rendered `Gate Runtime Map`, `runtime-flow-card`,
  `runtime-flow-node`, and `runtime-flow-edge`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py scripts/aios_dispatch.py`,

  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_control_snapshot

  Control Center DOM checks, and visual verification passed with receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-a57b49dff0a5/receipt.json`.
- next: inspect the Control Center on a real browser session and decide whether
  the runtime map should move into the first Evidence Desk or remain in
  operator mode below the fold.

## 2026-05-18 02:45 KST — codex — First-screen Decision Map added

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, refreshed
  Control Center snapshot assets, screenshot receipts, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the first Evidence Desk still behaved like a counter panel plus
  a long route list. Users could see that AIOS used MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  GenesisOS, and Hive, but the causal summary of why AIOS chose the current
  route required scrolling into operator sections.
- result: Evidence Desk now renders a compact `Decision Map` above the route
  rail. It summarizes Chair runtime/fallback, MemoryOS retrieval trace,
  CapabilityOS route edges, GenesisOS worldline edges, and Hive state in one
  readable micro-flow. The first attempt used five horizontal chips, but visual
  review showed labels truncating too aggressively; it was revised into a
  vertical micro-flow.
- evidence: DOM verification confirmed `Decision Map`,
  `command-decision-map`, and `command-decision-node`. Visual review of
  `.aios/screenshots/vis-42cd84c5a22b.png` confirmed readable Chair, Memory,
  Capability, Genesis, and Hive rows in the first viewport.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/app.js`,
  `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface -v`,
  Control Center DOM checks, and visual verification passed with receipt
  `.aios/visual_verification/vis-42cd84c5a22b/receipt.json`.
- next: convert this first-screen decision summary into a reusable component
  for standalone `chat.html`, so the dedicated chat view also shows systemic
  routing instead of only message bubbles and trace rows.

## 2026-05-18 02:49 KST — codex — Standalone chat gets AIOS Decision Map

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/chat.html`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, screenshot receipts, and this worklog.
- discomfort: the dedicated chat page was visually cleaner than the full
  Control Center, but that also made it look more like a normal chatbot. The
  AIOS route was present in per-message chips and trace artifacts, not as a
  persistent first-screen operating map.
- result: `chat.html` now includes a `Decision Map` above the conversation
  layout. `chat.js` initializes it in a waiting state and updates it after each
  assistant response using the chat payload's Chair, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  GenesisOS, and route fields. The map preserves simple chat ergonomics while
  making systemic routing visible.
- evidence: DOM verification confirmed `chat-decision-map`,
  `chat-decision-node`, `Decision Map`, and all five route labels. Visual
  review of `.aios/screenshots/vis-7336a92cd5ae.png` confirmed the map is
  visible above Recent Conversations, the thread, and the Evidence Desk.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/chat.js`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`,
  `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface
  tests.test_aios_chat -v`, DOM checks, and visual verification passed with
  receipt `.aios/visual_verification/vis-7336a92cd5ae/receipt.json`.
- next: make the dedicated chat Decision Map interactive enough to open the
  latest route artifacts directly, without expanding every trace row.

## 2026-05-18 02:53 KST — codex — Chat Decision Map opens route artifacts

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/chat.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this
  worklog.
- discomfort: the standalone chat Decision Map made systemic routing visible,
  but it was still passive. Users could see Chair, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS,
  GenesisOS, and Route, yet had to search trace rows manually to inspect the
  evidence behind each step.
- result: chat Decision Map nodes now become artifact-opening buttons whenever
  the latest chat payload carries a safe path. Chair opens `gate_chair_turns`,
  Memory opens `memory_context_pack`, Capability opens `capability_route`,
  Genesis opens `genesis_branches` or a friction seed, and Route opens an
  invocation receipt/cost artifact. The target opens in the existing Evidence
  Desk through the same read-only artifact API.
- evidence: live `/api/chat` smoke for conversation
  `decision-map-click-smoke` returned safe artifacts for
  `gate_chair_turns`, `memory_context_pack`, `capability_route`,
  `genesis_branches`, and `invocation_receipt`, plus MemoryOS trace
  `rtrace_fa53c56be6b162c6` and 5 Genesis branches.
- verification: `node --check apps/control/chat.js`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`,
  `python -m unittest
  tests.test_aios_local_app.AiosLocalAppTest.test_control_app_contains_end_user_ask_surface
  tests.test_aios_chat -v`, and DOM checks passed.
- next: move from UI visibility to governed action: accept/revise `ASC-0198`
  or create the next contract that turns these route maps into operator
  approval/replay workflows.

## 2026-05-18 02:57 KST — codex — Chat route promotion bridge

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, live promotion receipt, and this worklog.
- discomfort: chat route artifacts were inspectable, but turning a good route
  into governed work still required manually finding the session envelope and
  using the full Control Center promotion flow. The route map could show an
  operating decision but could not yet hand it to MyWorld as a proposed
  contract seed.
- result: added `POST /api/promote_chat_route`. It accepts a safe
  `.aios/invocations/**/receipt.json`, requires confirmation, reads the
  receipt's `session_envelope`, and reuses the existing session promotion
  writer. The chat trace now shows `Promote Route` on invocation receipts with
  a `reviewed route` checkbox. The API writes a promotion receipt and contract
  seed with `execution_started=false`.
- dogfood: after restarting the local app server, live API smoke promoted
  `.aios/invocations/chat-6372babf0c9ebf88/receipt.json` into
  `.aios/promotions/promotion-1d0db7e1e829-20260518T025653/contract_seed.md`
  with `status=proposed_contract_seed` and `execution_started=false`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js`, focused unittest coverage for
  `build_chat_route_promotion_response`, live `/api/promote_chat_route`
  smoke, and local app restart/up status passed.
- next: add a promotion queue affordance in chat so promoted route seeds can
  be materialized into `docs/contracts/ASC-....md` from the same conversation
  without losing the operator confirmation boundary.

## 2026-05-18 03:02 KST — codex — Weak route promotion quality gate

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/chat.js`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, live smoke
  receipts, and this worklog.
- discomfort: route promotion worked too well. A weak chat turn such as
  "현재 상태 알려줘" could become a generic `ASC-0199-aios-session.md`
  proposed contract. That proves the bridge, but it also recreates the
  "contract pile" failure mode the user has repeatedly pushed against.
- result: session/chat route promotions now compute
  `materialization_recommended` and `quality_warnings`. Warnings include a
  too-short goal, zero/missing MemoryOS signal coverage, missing CapabilityOS
  route, missing GenesisOS branch artifact, and missing dispatch preview.
  `POST /api/materialize_promotion_contract` now refuses weak promotions with
  `promotion_quality_warning` unless a future explicit override flow is added.
  Chat still preserves the weak route as evidence but labels it as needing
  revision.
- dogfood: restarted the local app and promoted
  `.aios/invocations/chat-6372babf0c9ebf88/receipt.json` again. The new
  promotion wrote
  `.aios/promotions/promotion-1d0db7e1e829-20260518T030137/promotion.json`
  with `materialization_recommended=false` and warnings
  `goal_too_short_for_contract_materialization` and
  `memory_signal_coverage_zero_or_missing`. A live materialization attempt for
  `ASC-0200` returned `promotion_quality_warning` and did not create a
  contract.
- note: `docs/contracts/ASC-0199-aios-session.md` was created before this gate
  landed and remains a proposed dogfood artifact. It should be revised into a
  specific contract or marked superseded by the quality-gated flow.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_local_app.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/chat.js`, focused unittest coverage for weak route
  blocking, local app restart/up, and live promotion/materialization smoke
  passed.
- next: add a lightweight review/supersede affordance for weak proposed
  contracts like `ASC-0199`, so dogfood artifacts do not accumulate as
  ambiguous open contracts.

## 2026-05-18 03:10 KST — codex — Weak proposed contract visibility

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: `ASC-0199-aios-session.md` was intentionally preserved as a
  dogfood artifact, but the Control Center contract lane still treated it like
  any other proposed contract. That made a weak route promotion look like
  normal backlog instead of evidence needing revision or supersession.
- result: contract snapshots now classify older session-promotion proposals
  with too-short goals, zero MemoryOS `signal_coverage`, or unnarrowed OS
  evidence as `weak_proposed`. The Control Center contract lane shows a
  `Revise` state and warning summary, while keeping the file auditable. It
  also exposes a guarded `Supersede` action that requires a `reviewed`
  checkbox, edits only safe proposed `docs/contracts/ASC-*.md` files, and
  writes an `.aios/contract_reviews/.../review_action.json` receipt without
  starting executor work.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py
  scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `node --check apps/control/app.js`, focused
  unittest coverage for weak contract classification and supersede action, and
  live snapshot inspection passed.
- next: improve deep-link visual verification for operator sections; DOM
  rendering is correct, but the current headless hash screenshot can capture a
  blank background even when the target row exists.

## 2026-05-18 03:17 KST — codex — Suspicious screenshot detection

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_visual_verify.py`, `tests/test_aios_visual_verify.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: `http://127.0.0.1:8765/?mode=operator#contract-flow` rendered
  the `ASC-0199 -> Revise` row in DOM, but headless screenshot capture wrote a
  blank 7 KB PNG and the verifier previously treated any non-empty screenshot
  as `passed`.
- result: visual verification now treats successful screenshots smaller than
  the default 12 KB threshold as `screenshot_suspiciously_small`. It retries
  fallbacks, records `browser_visual_evidence_suspicious`, and reports the
  run as degraded unless a real screenshot is produced. The threshold is
  configurable with `--min-screenshot-bytes`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_visual_verify.py`,
  `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_visual_verify -v`, and a live
  `#contract-flow` verification produced a degraded receipt with
  `browser_visual_evidence_suspicious` instead of a false pass.
- next: replace hash-only section screenshots with a stable operator-section
  visual harness so a target section can be captured directly without relying
  on browser hash scroll timing.

## 2026-05-18 03:20 KST — codex — Operator section visual focus harness

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/app.js`, `apps/control/styles.css`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this
  worklog.
- discomfort: hash-only screenshots such as
  `?mode=operator#contract-flow` can render the target in DOM but still capture
  a blank viewport in headless browser timing. For UI work, degraded evidence
  is useful, but designers also need a stable way to capture the exact operator
  section under review.
- result: Control Center now supports
  `?mode=operator&visual_focus=<section-id>`. It clones the requested safe
  section into a first-viewport `visual-focus-harness` and hides the rest of
  the shell for screenshot purposes. This keeps normal UI unchanged while
  making targeted visual verification deterministic.
- verification: static test coverage now asserts the visual focus hook and CSS
  harness exist; live verification should use
  `http://127.0.0.1:8765/?mode=operator&visual_focus=contract-flow`.
- next: use the visual focus harness for all future Control Center section
  screenshots, then add a small reference-gallery strip so before/after visual
  evidence is visible inside the app itself.

## 2026-05-18 03:25 KST — codex — Control Center visual evidence strip

- status: done
- scope: `apps/control/index.html`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: screenshot and verification receipts existed, but the operator
  had to know the paths under `.aios/screenshots` and
  `.aios/visual_verification` to review the design loop. That made the
  screenshot-first workflow a hidden developer habit instead of an end-user
  interface capability.
- result: the Control Center now has a `Reference / Build / Verify` visual
  evidence strip backed by existing `GET /api/visual_workflow`. It shows the
  latest reference/build screenshot thumbnail and a compact verification
  receipt summary directly in the app, reusing the same evidence source as
  `chat.html`. The workflow response now prefers the screenshot cited by the
  latest visual verification receipt as the `Build` image, so it does not
  silently show an older `after` file when a newer verification exists.
- verification: static app test coverage asserts the new Control Center visual
  workflow hooks and CSS exist; live visual verification confirmed the strip
  renders in the first viewport.
- next: live-verify the new strip and then connect failed/degraded visual
  receipts back into the Evidence Desk as actionable UI work, not only passive
  receipt text.

## 2026-05-18 03:32 KST — codex — Visual receipt to UI work item

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_local_app.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, and this worklog.
- discomfort: degraded visual receipts were visible, but still passive. The
  operator could see that visual verification had a problem, but the app did
  not turn that evidence into a concrete AIOS work prompt.
- result: `GET /api/visual_workflow` now emits a
  `visual_fix_work_item` action when the latest visual verification receipt is
  `degraded` or `failed`. The Control Center renders it as a `Visual Fix` row
  in the Evidence Desk. The row can prepare an inline AIOS prompt and can also
  `Promote Fix` after a `reviewed` checkbox. `POST /api/promote_visual_fix`
  accepts only safe visual verification receipts with actionable status, writes
  a `proposed_contract_seed` promotion under `.aios/promotions/`, and keeps
  `execution_started=false`.
- verification: unit tests cover the action payload, promotion writer, and
  static UI hooks; live smoke created a degraded receipt and confirmed the
  Evidence Desk row appears.
- next: live-smoke `Promote Fix` through the local API, then materialize one
  promoted visual fix into a proposed ASC only after checking its quality.

## 2026-05-18 03:40 KST — codex — Promotion queue next-ASC polish

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`, `apps/control/app.js`,
  `apps/control/styles.css`, `tests/test_aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_local_app.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTROL_APP.md`, live visual
  receipt, and this worklog.
- discomfort: Visual Fix promotion worked, but the promotion queue still used
  an old hard-coded `ASC-0186` placeholder and long `next_action` text wrapped
  awkwardly inside cards. That made a governed next step feel manually patched
  instead of system-owned.
- result: the control snapshot now reports `promotions.next_contract_id` and
  each promotion item carries the same suggested id. The Control Center
  materialization input is prefilled with the current next ASC (`ASC-0200` in
  this workspace), and long `next` values are ellipsized with the full value in
  the tooltip.
- dogfood: refreshed the snapshot and verified the promotion queue with
  `?mode=operator&visual_focus=promotion-queue-grid`; the first card is the
  visual-fix promotion and its materialization input now shows `ASC-0200`.
- verification: `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_control_snapshot.py`,
  `node --check apps/control/app.js`, focused snapshot/UI tests, visual
  verification receipt `.aios/visual_verification/vis-c1f1993df65c/receipt.json`,
  and `git diff --check` passed.
- next: do not auto-materialize the dogfood visual-fix promotion until its
  receipt is still actionable after the visual-focus harness; instead add a
  quality marker for promotions that are already solved by a later fix.

## 2026-05-20 23:18 KST — codex — Claude founder-alignment override

- status: done
- scope: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- directive: founder stated that AIOS should stop growing contracts
  indefinitely and that Codex/Claude should take the founder vision as
  delegated senior-engineering authority: build the Hermes-style execution
  organism, not more self-referential governance.
- result: added a top-level `Founder Alignment Override — 2026-05-20` to
  `CLAUDE.md`. Claude must read `docs/AIOS_MINIMUM_KERNEL_AUDIT.md`, treat ASC
  creation as frozen by default, and prioritize kernel extraction, `aios` head
  implementation, provider adapter consolidation, and outside-domain proof.
- verification: no new ASC contract was created; this is a direct provider
  alignment handoff for Claude Code.
- next: next AIOS work should select or execute an outside-domain proof task
  and build only the minimum head/kernel pieces needed to complete it.

## 2026-05-20 23:27 KST — codex — Hybrid path selected

- status: done
- scope: `docs/AIOS_MINIMUM_KERNEL_AUDIT.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- directive: founder clarified the target: AIOS should use provider CLIs to
  hold delegated device authority, complete tasks, and grow itself from those
  task traces.
- decision: selected path C, hybrid. Draft one small `ContractObject` schema
  first, then immediately run an outside-domain task through it instead of
  continuing bottom-up self-development.
- result: updated the minimum kernel audit with `Chosen path — C. Hybrid`,
  including why A and B are weaker, the execution sequence, and the distinction
  between contract files as history and contract objects as the AIOS process
  model.
- next: write the minimal runtime-object schema, then use the privacy-gated
  personal file organization task as the first live specimen.

## 2026-06-01 15:21 KST — codex — ContractObject v0 runtime spec

- status: done
- scope: `scripts/aios_contract_object.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_contract_object.py`, `docs/AIOS_CONTRACT_OBJECT_V0.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_MINIMUM_KERNEL_AUDIT.md`, and this worklog.
- intent: proceed with path C by making contracts executable runtime objects
  before touching private personal files or creating another ASC.
- result: added `schema_version=aios.contract_object.v0`, delegated device
  authority metadata, receipt-required authority, duplicate-step validation,
  full authority validation over steps, and a `specimen personal-files`
  generator for privacy-gated personal file organization.
- safety: the specimen disables network, forbids delete operations, separates
  read/write/move scopes, lets deny paths override allowed paths, requires
  user checkpoints before plan acceptance, file mutation, and memory writeback,
  and writes memory effects as draft-first only.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_contract_object -v`
  passed 14 tests; `python -m py_compile scripts/aios_contract_object.py`
  passed; a `/tmp` personal-files specimen validated with
  `python scripts/aios_contract_object.py validate /dev/stdin`.
- next: choose exact input/output roots for the personal file organization
  proof and run only the inventory/planning/checkpoint steps first.

## 2026-06-05 04:43 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0224 cleanup dispatch closed

- status: done
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0224-resolve-memoryos-monitor-dirty-state-through-owner-reviewed-provenance-cleanup.md`,
  `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`,
  `scripts/aios_commit_guard.py`, `scripts/aios_guard_hook.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_commit_guard.py`, regenerated Control Center snapshot
  data, and the `memoryOS` submodule pointer.
- external/provider evidence: checked the official Git `git-status`
  documentation for porcelain stability and `??` untracked semantics; ran
  Gemini and Codex as independent reviewers. Gemini flagged quoted-path
  parsing risk; Codex flagged path-only cleanup masking later same-file
  changes. Claude timed out before returning a review. `claude`, `codex`, and
  `gemini` CLIs are installed; common local LLM launchers were not found.
- change: `allowed_existing_dirty` now travels in dispatch packets with an
  automatically captured `allowed_existing_dirty_baseline` containing
  porcelain status and SHA-256. The child watcher ignores a pre-existing dirty
  cleanup input only when the current status and hash still match that
  baseline; other overlapping dirty work still triggers `pending_concurrent_work`.
- ASC-0224 execution: dispatched `asc-0224` to `memoryOS`; child watcher ran
  `codex`, returned `status=passed`, and MemoryOS committed/pushed
  `0b3e973` (`Resolve ASC-0224 URI seed provenance cleanup`). The prior
  `.tmp_uri_cleanroom_seed.md` dirty entry is gone.
- verification: `python -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch
  tests.test_aios_child_watcher -v` passed 46 tests; `python -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_dispatch.py` and `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`
  passed; `git -C memoryOS diff --check` passed; `python
  scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json` reports health `watch` and no
  `repo_dirty` findings.
- caveat: MemoryOS `memoryos doctor --json` reported a pre-existing invalid
  JSONL row in `memory/retrieval_traces.jsonl` line 11827, outside ASC-0224
  scope.
- next: continue from monitor `watch` health; open advisory items remain
  GenesisOS prompt-prison and persona-axis review, not repo dirty cleanup.

## 2026-06-05 05:02 KST — codex@myworld — Genesis advisory review loop tightened

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: reduce monitor noise without disabling GenesisOS prompt-prison critique.
- changed: `scripts/aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py`,
  `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `tests/test_aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_monitor.py`, and Genesis escape-review sections in
  `ASC-0212` through `ASC-0215`.
- evidence: `codex exec` and `claude -p` reviewed the design; both supported
  splitting `reviewed_flagged` from `unreviewed_flagged` while warning about
  stale or boilerplate reviews. `gemini` hit model capacity/backpressure before
  returning. `python scripts/aios_genesis_critic_dispatch.py --limit 25 --json`
  reports `flagged_count=1`, `unreviewed_flagged_count=0`,
  `reviewed_flagged_count=1`; `python scripts/aios_monitor.py assess --json`
  reports only `persona_axis_advisory`.
- decision: the critic still records all signatures, but monitor action is
  reserved for unreviewed prompt-prison findings. A complete review requires
  Assumptions, Counter branch, Plain Language, Cross-Domain Frame, and Time
  Horizons with non-trivial body length.
- risk: deterministic completeness cannot prove semantic quality; reviewed
  findings can become stale after contract edits. Future work should add a
  periodic semantic sample audit.
- next: address the remaining `persona_axis_advisory` by improving role
  evidence or marking justified absences in active/open contracts.
- status: done

## 2026-06-05 05:00 KST — codex@myworld — Persona-axis justified absence handling

- repo: myworld
- role: implementation
- goal: keep persona-axis advisory honest by distinguishing silent worker-mode
  drift from explicit 5-persona role evidence or justified absence.
- provider review: `codex exec --sandbox read-only` warned that "not required"
  can become a scoring loophole unless waiver/evidence state is preserved
  separately. `claude -p` timed out, `gemini -p` hit model capacity/backpressure,
  and common local LLM launchers were not found.
- changed: `scripts/aios_persona_audit.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_persona_audit.py`, and regenerated Control Center snapshot
  data.
- result: persona audit now records `role_evidence`,
  `justified_absences`, and strict `evidence_scores`. `scores` measure handled
  role evidence; `evidence_scores` preserve the old strict heuristic signal so
  documented waivers do not erase the evidence gap.
- evidence: focused persona audit tests pass 5/5; related monitor/control
  snapshot tests pass 37/37. Current monitor health remains `watch`, with
  `persona_composite=0.58` and only `retriever_score` under 0.5.
- next: future contracts should cite actual `rtrace_...` and positive
  `signal_coverage` where MemoryOS retrieval is truly required, instead of
  relying on justified absence.

## 2026-06-13 15:07 KST — codex@myworld — Runtime isolation finish-forward and serving UI boundary

- status: started
- scope: `docs/contracts/ASC-0250-build-runtime-isolation-finish-forward.md`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0251-end-user-serving-interface-spine.md`, and dispatch
  packet preparation.
- context: ASC-0249 left useful partial changes in
  `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `scripts/aios_monitor.py`, and
  `scripts/aios_round_controller.py`; focused tests pass, but dedicated
  ASC-0249 tests and closeout evidence are missing.
- external evidence: checked current OpenAI Agents SDK docs for sessions,
  tracing, tools, sandbox agents, sandbox memory, and provider/runtime
  separation; checked Anthropic Claude Managed Agents release notes; checked
  Gemini Interactions API and Deep Research Agent docs.
- local helper evidence: `cap_helper_operator_review` classified the partial
  ASC-0249 state as `NEEDS-REVIEW`; `cap_helper_consolidate` was used as
  non-authoritative local context.
- decision: do not claim AIOS has a true end-user serving interface. Current
  `apps/control` is an operator/local workbench. Finish ASC-0249 first, then
  build a separate serving surface.
- next: dispatch ASC-0250 to Claude for tests/closeout; keep ASC-0251 proposed
  until the runtime boundary is closed.

## 2026-06-13 15:24 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0250 verified and collected

- status: done
- scope: ASC-0249/ASC-0250 closeout and verification.
- result: Claude finished the build/runtime profile boundary with dedicated
  tests and a passed result packet at
  `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0250.myworld.result.json`.
- verification: Codex reran
  `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch tests.test_aios_child_watcher tests.test_aios_round_controller tests.test_aios_monitor -v`
  and got 101/101 OK; `python3 -m py_compile
  scripts/aios_dispatch.py scripts/aios_round_controller.py
  scripts/aios_monitor.py`, `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`, and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- decision: ASC-0249 and ASC-0250 are closed. `build_control` is the default
  runtime profile and visibly blocks live child execution; `live_agent_runtime`
  or explicit per-run allowance opens it. Stale provider-session leases after
  result packets now surface as monitor risk and clear after lease removal.
- next: ASC-0251 remains proposed for the first true end-user serving
  interface, separate from `apps/control`.

## 2026-06-13 15:31 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0251 serving interface design gate

- status: started

  `docs/product/AIOS_END_USER_SERVING_INTERFACE_SPEC.md`,
  `docs/product/AIOS_SERVING_INTERFACE_ROUTE_MAP.md`, and ledger/worklog
  entries.
- context: ASC-0249/0250 closed the local build/runtime boundary. Current
  `apps/control` remains an operator/local surface, not a user serving UI.
- Product Design preflight: no saved Product Design context exists, so this
  contract is design/spec only and must not scaffold UI before a visual target
  is chosen.
- decision: accept ASC-0251 as a Claude-owned design/spec packet, with
  implementation explicitly forbidden in this slice.
- next: dispatch ASC-0251 to Claude; Codex verifies the spec is concrete enough
  for a later prototype contract.

## 2026-06-13 15:39 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0251 spec verified

- result: Claude produced `docs/product/AIOS_END_USER_SERVING_INTERFACE_SPEC.md`
  and `docs/product/AIOS_SERVING_INTERFACE_ROUTE_MAP.md`, plus a passed result
  packet at `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0251.myworld.result.json`.
- verification: dispatch status shows ASC-0251 collected; monitor health is
  `watch`; `.aios/leases` was cleared after the collected result; `git diff
  --check` passed after a small whitespace cleanup in the spec header.
- decision: ASC-0251 is closed as design/spec only. It proves the serving UI
  boundary and future acceptance gates; it does not implement `apps/serving/`.
- next: create a separate prototype contract for the first end-user workflow
  once a visual direction/target is selected.

## 2026-06-13 15:47 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0252 readiness gate correction

- status: starting
- scope: correct the world-deployment readiness gate so it no longer claims
  service deployment readiness while the end-user serving surface is only a
  spec.
- owner split: Codex creates the contract, records the overclaim evidence, and
  dispatches; Claude owns the bounded CLI/test/docs correction.
- expected files: `docs/contracts/ASC-0252-serving-readiness-gate-correction.md`,
  `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`, `tests/test_aios_world_readiness.py`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- deferred: no `apps/serving/` implementation until a separate prototype
  contract and visual/product direction are accepted.

## 2026-06-13 15:38 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0252 verified after Claude

- status: done
- scope: verify Claude's ASC-0252 readiness gate correction and set the next
  action to the follow-on serving prototype scope.
- result: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py` now includes
  `end_user_serving_readiness`; current repo reports
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false` with seven infrastructure axes met and
  the serving axis partial.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_world_readiness -v`
  passed 6/6; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/aios_world_readiness.py` passed;
  `git diff --check` passed; readiness JSON emitted a valid not-ready payload.
- dispatch note: `.aios/outbox/myworld/asc-0252.myworld.result.json` reports
  Claude passed; `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo myworld` still
  returns `unsupported repo: myworld`, so myworld-targeted Claude dispatch
  execution needs a first-class bridge.
- next: ASC-0253 proposed for the actual `apps/serving/` prototype after
  Product Design brief/visual target confirmation.

## 2026-06-13 15:42 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0254 myworld provider dispatch bridge

- status: starting
- scope: make `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` support `--repo myworld` so
  myworld-targeted Claude/Codex/Gemini/local provider packets can execute
  through the same receipt path as child repos.
- reason: ASC-0252 proved the gap: `aios_dispatch.py` can send `myworld`
  packets, but `aios_child_watcher.sh once --repo myworld` returns
  `unsupported repo: myworld`.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh`,
  `tests/test_aios_child_watcher.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0254-myworld-provider-dispatch-bridge.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- deferred: no `apps/serving/` UI work until Product Design visual target and
  ASC-0253 acceptance.

## 2026-06-13 15:46 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0254 closed

- status: done
- scope: myworld provider dispatch bridge.
- result: `scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` supports `myworld` in `repo_path`,
  usage, status, and explicit `--repo all` start/stop loops.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_child_watcher -v` passed
  19/19; `bash -n scripts/aios_child_watcher.sh` passed; `git diff --check`
  passed. New test proves a myworld packet runs from the workspace root and
  writes `.aios/outbox/myworld/<id>.myworld.result.json`.
- decision: future myworld-targeted Claude/Codex/Gemini/local work can use the
  watcher bridge instead of manual side channels.
- next: ASC-0253 can be accepted/refined after Product Design visual target;
  the dispatch bridge is no longer the blocker.

## 2026-06-13 15:48 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0255 serving runtime/session boundary

- status: starting
- scope: delegate the non-UI `end_user_serving` runtime/session primitive to
  Claude through the now-working myworld watcher bridge.
- reason: ASC-0253 UI remains Product Design-gated, but the runtime/session
  boundary is a service-readiness prerequisite that can progress without visual
  design.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `scripts/aios_round_controller.py`,
  `scripts/aios_serving_session.py`, `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_round_controller.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_serving_session.py`, `tests/test_aios_world_readiness.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0255-end-user-serving-runtime-session-boundary.md`,
  `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`, `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`.
- deferred: no `apps/serving/` UI until Product Design visual target/brief is
  confirmed.

## 2026-06-13 15:53 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0255 closed

- status: done
- scope: non-UI `end_user_serving` runtime/session boundary only.
- result: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py` recognizes `end_user_serving` without
  weakening `build_control`; `scripts/aios_serving_session.py` creates
  deterministic `aios.serving_session.v1` records under
  `.aios/serving/workspaces/<user>/<session>/serving_session.json`.
- verification: focused unittest gate passed 81/81; py_compile passed for
  `aios_dispatch.py`, `aios_round_controller.py`, `aios_serving_session.py`,
  and `aios_world_readiness.py`; readiness JSON remains conservative with
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false`, `met_count=7`, `partial_count=1`,
  `end_user_serving_readiness=partial`, `next_action=ASC-0253`; `git diff
  --check` passed.
- decision: serving sessions require safe user/session path segments, approval
  before sensitive actions, draft-only memory writes, and no credential/raw log
  fields.
- next: ASC-0253 serving UI/prototype remains gated on Product Design visual
  target selection and browser proof.

## 2026-06-13 16:05 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0256 dispatch agent binding hygiene

- status: starting
- scope: fix `aios_dispatch.py send` so an existing inbox packet cannot
  silently preserve a stale/default provider when the operator requests a
  different agent.
- reason: ASC-0255 was intended for `claude@myworld` but executed as
  `codex@myworld`; serving-grade AIOS needs provider assignment to be binding
  and auditable.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0256-dispatch-agent-binding-hygiene.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- deferred: no `apps/serving/` UI work and no child repo implementation in
  this contract.

## 2026-06-13 16:12 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0256 closed

- status: done
- scope: dispatch agent binding hygiene.
- result: `send` now reads any existing inbox packet before overwrite. If the
  packet's `agent` differs from the requested `--agent`, it records either
  `agent_binding_mismatch` or `agent_reassign_blocked` and refuses to rewrite
  the packet, even with `--force`.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch -v` passed
  52/52; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/aios_dispatch.py` passed; `git diff
  --check` passed.
- decision: existing inbox packet agent assignment is immutable across provider
  names because watcher pickup can race with reassignment. Reissuing to Claude
  must use a new explicit dispatch/stop/archive path.
- next: future Claude-owned serving work must verify the packet `agent` before
  watcher execution. Add a dedicated cancel/archive/reissue command if stale
  packet replacement becomes common.

## 2026-06-13 19:13 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0257 dispatch cancel/archive/reissue

- status: starting
- scope: open a control-plane lifecycle contract that lets a wrong-agent
  dispatch be cancelled/archived and reissued under a new dispatch id without
  rewriting existing packet or result evidence.
- reason: ASC-0256 correctly made packet `agent` immutable across provider
  names; serving-grade AIOS still needs an explicit recovery path when an
  operator intended Claude/Gemini/local but a stale packet already exists.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0257-dispatch-cancel-archive-reissue.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- delegated: first implementation attempt should route to `claude@myworld`
  with provider fallback disabled so a Claude failure is visible.
- deferred: no `apps/serving/` UI work, no provider credential changes, and no
  child repo implementation in this contract.

## 2026-06-13 19:18 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0257 closed

- status: done
- scope: dispatch cancel/archive/reissue lifecycle primitive.
- result: `aios_dispatch.py reissue` creates a new dispatch id for the intended
  agent, archives a pending source inbox packet when no result evidence exists,
  and preserves/cites source result evidence when execution already happened.
- Claude attempt: `asc-0257` was correctly addressed to `claude`, but the child
  watcher held with `pending_concurrent_work`; fallback was disabled so this
  degraded receipt stayed visible.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_dispatch -v` passed
  55/55; `python3 -m py_compile scripts/aios_dispatch.py` passed; `git diff
  --check` passed.
- decision: wrong-agent recovery is now a new dispatch lineage, not packet
  mutation.
- next: future Claude/Gemini/local serving packets can be reissued cleanly if a
  stale wrong-agent packet blocks execution. UI/API affordance remains future
  `apps/serving/` work.

## 2026-06-13 19:21 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0258 serving design gate

- status: starting
- scope: make the Product Design prerequisite for ASC-0253 machine-checkable
  without implementing `apps/serving/`.
- reason: Product Design preflight reports no saved user context; ASC-0253
  still lacks a confirmed product brief, visual target, and interactivity
  level, so building UI would violate the no-visual-target/no-build rule.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py`,
  `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`, `tests/test_aios_serving_design_gate.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_world_readiness.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0258-serving-design-gate.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- deferred: no UI scaffold, no browser server, no image generation, and no
  `apps/serving/**` changes in this contract.

## 2026-06-13 19:23 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0258 closed

- status: done
- scope: machine-checkable Product Design gate for ASC-0253.
- result: added `scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py` and tests. The gate
  assesses product goal, visual target, interactivity level, user confirmation,
  build allowance, and stop conditions. Current repo reports `ready=false`
  because `.aios/serving/design_gate.json` is missing.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_serving_design_gate
  tests.test_aios_world_readiness -v` passed 15/15; py_compile passed; serving
  design gate JSON reports `status=missing`; world readiness remains
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false`.
- decision: ASC-0253 is now blocked by a concrete gate artifact, not implicit
  chat memory. UI work still requires Product Design brief/visual target
  confirmation.
- next: ask/confirm the serving design brief, then write
  `.aios/serving/design_gate.json` and proceed through Product Design ideation
  or implementation rules.

## 2026-06-13 19:27 KST — codex@myworld — starting ASC-0259 serving design gate intake

- status: starting
- scope: add a deterministic Product Design intake path for the serving design
  gate without building UI.
- reason: ASC-0258 made the gate checkable, but `needs_ideation` must be
  separated from build permission and the operator questions should be
  generated by AIOS instead of implicit chat memory.
- expected files: `scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py`,
  `tests/test_aios_serving_design_gate.py`,
  `docs/contracts/ASC-0259-serving-design-gate-intake.md`,
  `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`.
- deferred: no `apps/serving/**` changes, no generated visual targets, and no
  browser proof in this contract.

## 2026-06-13 19:31 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0259 closed

- status: done
- scope: serving design gate intake and ideation/build separation.
- result: `aios_serving_design_gate.py` now supports `questions` and `draft`.
  Drafts can be printed without writing, or written with `--write`.
- correction: `visual_target_type=needs_ideation` now requires
  `next_product_design_step=ideate` and `build_allowed=false`; concrete visual
  targets require `next_product_design_step=prototype` and `build_allowed=true`.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_serving_design_gate -v`
  passed 10/10; py_compile passed; `questions --json` and `draft --json`
  produced expected machine-readable payloads.
- decision: the next serving step can ask deterministic Product Design
  questions and create `.aios/serving/design_gate.json` only after operator
  confirmation.
- next: obtain/confirm the serving design brief; if no visual source is
  provided, route ASC-0253 to Product Design ideation before implementation.

## 2026-06-13 19:40 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0260 real-user serving release spine accepted

- status: accepted / dispatched
- scope: reframe serving as a real end-user served product, not local demo or
  operator UI reuse.
- operator confirmation: "아예 User들이 사용할 때 진짜 서빙용".
- gate update: `.aios/serving/design_gate.json` now records the product goal as
  real end-user AIOS serving, with `visual_target_type=needs_ideation`,
  `next_product_design_step=ideate`, and `build_allowed=false`.
- result: added `docs/contracts/ASC-0260-real-user-serving-release-spine.md`
  and narrowed `ASC-0253` to visual/prototype scope only.
- routing: CapabilityOS recommended AIOS readiness scoring, route planning, and
  child watcher orchestration; GenesisOS critique required schema/table-based
  framing and explicit assumptions, so ASC-0260 uses an owner/evidence matrix.
- decision: no `apps/serving/**` implementation until Product Design ideation
  produces a concrete visual target; production readiness also requires runtime,
  auth/session, memory, provider-access, observability, support, and
  launch-proof contracts.
- next: dispatch WP-0260-A to `claude@myworld` for an implementation contract
  pack; keep world readiness false until real serving evidence exists.

## 2026-06-13 20:05 KST — claude@myworld — ASC-0260 WP-0260-A: implementation contract pack

Produced below per WP-0260-A brief. Contract freeze remains in effect; this
entry is the owner-bound planning record until each slice's execution contract
is explicitly requested by the founder.

### Slice 1 — Product Design ideation

- owner: `myworld` operator (founder + claude)
- dispatch_to: none — operator-owned deliberation
- output: 3–5 serving interface directions → one accepted visual target
- allowed_files: `.aios/serving/design_gate.json`, `docs/product/`
- acceptance_evidence: `design_gate.json` updated with concrete `visual_target_type` (`url`/`image`/`figma`/`screenshot`/`design_system`); `build_allowed=true`; design brief committed to `docs/product/AIOS_SERVING_DESIGN_BRIEF.md`
- stop_conditions: `ui_implementation_before_visual_target`, `operator_control_center_reused_as_visual_target`
- unblocks: Slice 2 (UI prototype)

### Slice 2 — End-user serving UI prototype (ASC-0253)

- owner: `myworld`
- dispatch_to: `claude@myworld`
- depends_on: Slice 1 (`build_allowed=true`)
- output: `apps/serving/**` route set (6 routes from ASC-0251 spec)
- allowed_files: `apps/serving/**`, `scripts/aios_serving_session.py`, `tests/test_aios_serving_e2e.py`, `tests/test_aios_serving_*.py`, `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`
- acceptance_evidence:
  - browser proof at 375px + 1280px for 4 flows: new task, approval, memory draft review, artifact download
  - `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` serving axis → `met` (met_markers exist)
  - `?mock=true` fixture mode on all 6 routes
- stop_conditions: `serving_ui_reuses_operator_control_center`, `local_demo_claimed_as_real_serving`, `world_readiness_claim_without_browser_proof`, `session_boundary_ambiguous`, `approval_path_missing`

### Slice 3 — `end_user_serving` runtime profile (myworld + hivemind)

- owner: `myworld` (dispatch write) + `hivemind` (execution enforcement)
- dispatch_to: `claude@myworld` then `codex@hivemind`
- output: `end_user_serving` added to `RUNTIME_PROFILES` in `aios_dispatch.py`; user/session-scoped authority in `aios_round_controller.py`; `aios_serving_session.py` session lifecycle
- allowed_files: `scripts/aios_dispatch.py`, `scripts/aios_serving_session.py`, `tests/test_aios_dispatch.py`, `tests/test_aios_serving_session.py`
- acceptance_evidence:
  - `runtime_profile_state(root, override='end_user_serving')` returns valid state
  - tests prove `build_control` state and operator-only paths not exposed to `end_user_serving` context
  - session create/resume/expire lifecycle with `user_id` + `session_id` in receipts
- stop_conditions: `operator_state_exposed_to_user_session`, `cross_user_session_read`, `live_child_execution_without_user_scope`

### Slice 4 — Hivemind hosted worker queue/resume

- owner: `hivemind`
- dispatch_to: `codex@hivemind`
- depends_on: Slice 3 (runtime profile exists)
- output: user task queue worker, `aios_run_log`-backed resume, per-user sandbox receipts
- allowed_files: `hivemind/**` (owner-bound)
- acceptance_evidence:
  - two interrupted jobs resume from run-log receipts without duplicate sensitive actions
  - provider call receipts carry `user_id` + `session_id`
  - queue/retry does not re-execute stages already recorded as complete
- stop_conditions: `duplicate_sensitive_action_on_retry`, `cross_user_worker_state_access`, `provider_credentials_in_receipt`

### Slice 5 — MemoryOS per-user memory lifecycle

- owner: `memoryOS`
- dispatch_to: `codex@memoryOS`
- output: per-user `namespace` tag, draft-first lifecycle API, export/delete request receipts
- allowed_files: `memoryOS/**` (owner-bound)
- acceptance_evidence:
  - `aios_retrieve` with `user_id=A` cannot return records tagged `user_id=B`
  - memory draft requires explicit user review before `status=accepted`
  - export request emits `aios.export_request.v1`; deletion request emits `aios.deletion_request.v1` (append-only, per DNA invariant 3)
- stop_conditions: `cross_user_memory_visible`, `auto_accept_without_user_review`, `deletion_request_destroys_record`

### Slice 6 — CapabilityOS provider-access/rate/consent routing

- owner: `CapabilityOS`
- dispatch_to: `codex@CapabilityOS`
- output: per-user connector access-grant scopes, rate/cost limits, consent gate check before dispatch
- allowed_files: `CapabilityOS/**` (owner-bound)
- acceptance_evidence:
  - denial receipts produced for missing consent before any provider call
  - rate/budget limit refusal recorded before dispatch (not after)
  - user revoke of a provider connector propagates to active session within one round
- stop_conditions: `provider_call_without_consent_check`, `budget_exceeded_without_refusal_receipt`, `access_grant_leaked_across_users`

### Slice 7 — Observability and support redaction (myworld + memoryOS)

- owner: `myworld`
- dispatch_to: `claude@myworld`
- output: redacted job timeline endpoint, incident support view with stage/error metadata only
- allowed_files: `scripts/aios_serving_session.py`, `tests/test_aios_serving_support.py`, `scripts/aios_monitor.py`
- acceptance_evidence:
  - `support/incident/:id` view contains stage names + status codes + error types, not raw message bodies or memory content
  - `admin/audit/:id` view contains operator-visible summaries, not raw user content
  - tests prove raw tool output and memory bodies absent from support/admin views
- stop_conditions: `raw_user_content_in_support_view`, `cross_user_incident_access`, `operator_audit_exposes_user_memory_body`

### Slice 8 — Release readiness gate update (myworld)

- owner: `myworld`
- dispatch_to: `claude@myworld`
- depends_on: Slices 2–7 (all serving evidence markers must exist)
- output: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py` serving axis `met` only when all slice evidence exists; `scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py` reports production-serving status
- allowed_files: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py`, `tests/test_aios_world_readiness.py`, `scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py`
- acceptance_evidence:
  - `aios_world_readiness.py --json` → `ready_for_world_deployment=true` only when all 8 axes met
  - infra + spec + prototype alone cannot satisfy the full gate
  - gate provides checklist of all required serving evidence markers
- stop_conditions: `prototype_claimed_as_world_ready`, `infra_markers_sufficient_for_world_ready`

### Slice 9 — GenesisOS pre-launch adversarial challenge

- owner: `GenesisOS`
- dispatch_to: `codex@GenesisOS` or operator-run challenge script
- depends_on: Slices 2–8 (launch candidate must exist)
- output: adversarial review of privacy, abuse, frozen-knowledge, and assumption-negation risks
- allowed_files: `GenesisOS/**` (owner-bound), `docs/contracts/` (advisory record)
- acceptance_evidence:
  - no unresolved cross-user data, authority, or support-risk findings
  - explicit refutation or mitigation for each of ASC-0260's three negated assumptions
  - adversarial challenge receipt committed before release gate closes
- stop_conditions: `launch_closes_without_adversarial_review`, `assumption_not_negated`, `privacy_risk_unresolved`

### Execution order

```
Slice 1 (ideation) → Slice 2 (UI prototype, if visual target accepted)
Slice 3 (runtime profile) → parallel → Slice 4 (hivemind worker), Slice 5 (memoryOS)
Slice 6 (CapabilityOS) → parallel with 4+5
Slice 7 (observability) → after Slice 3+5
Slice 8 (readiness gate) → after all slices 2–7 closed
Slice 9 (adversarial challenge) → after Slice 8, before release
```

Current gate state: `build_allowed=false`, `visual_target_type=needs_ideation`.
Slice 1 must run before Slice 2. All others may proceed in parallel with operator
oversight once their dependencies close.

## 2026-06-13 20:18 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0261 production-serving release gate

- status: closed
- scope: make the ASC-0260 real-user serving slices machine-checkable without
  implementing `apps/serving/**` or child repo code.
- result: added `scripts/aios_serving_release_gate.py` with a 9-slice JSON
  assessment for Product Design, UI prototype, runtime, Hivemind worker,
  MemoryOS lifecycle, CapabilityOS access routing, observability/support,
  release gate, and Genesis pre-launch challenge.
- world readiness binding: `scripts/aios_world_readiness.py` now requires the
  serving release gate to be ready before `end_user_serving_readiness` can be
  `met`; old prototype markers alone remain partial.
- current evidence: release gate reports `ready_for_production_serving=false`,
  `met=2`, `partial=5`, `missing=2`; next action is Product Design ideation
  because `design_gate.json` remains `needs_ideation` and `build_allowed=false`.
- verification: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_serving_release_gate
  tests.test_aios_world_readiness -v` passed 17/17; py_compile passed; world
  readiness remains `ready_for_world_deployment=false`.
- decision: no future agent can make AIOS world-ready by adding only
  `apps/serving/index.html` plus a broad e2e test; all ASC-0260 serving slices
  need explicit evidence.
- next: Slice 1 Product Design ideation remains the first release blocker; in
  parallel, owner-bound child contracts can prepare Hivemind, MemoryOS, and
  CapabilityOS slice implementations.

## 2026-06-13 20:25 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0262 agent-service baseline absorbed

- status: closed
- scope: refresh official agent-service infrastructure baseline and bind it to
  the AIOS serving release path without building UI.
- sources checked: OpenAI Agents SDK/Responses/Sandbox Agents/Codex cloud;
  Anthropic Claude Managed Agents release notes; Google Gemini Interactions,
  Deep Research, and session-resumption notes.
- result: added `docs/research/AIOS_AGENT_SERVICE_BASELINE_2026-06-13.md`.
  The baseline maps external provider evolution into AIOS primitives:
  durable session state, resumable sandbox workspaces, typed execution steps,
  background jobs, vault/access-grant credentials, governed memory, cited web
  ingestion, and pre-release anti-convergence challenge.
- release gate binding: `scripts/aios_serving_release_gate.py` now requires
  the baseline doc in the release-readiness slice.
- Product Design state: user-context preflight reports no saved design context;
  the serving brief is playable but not yet visually grounded. Next design
  workflow remains ideation, not prototype/build.
- verification: serving release gate remains not ready; world readiness remains
  false; no `apps/serving/**` implementation was created.
- next: ask/confirm Product Design brief playback, then run Slice 1 ideation
  to produce exactly three visual options before any prototype work.

## 2026-06-13 20:13 KST — codex@myworld — ASC-0263..0266 serving owner packets executed

- status: closed for ASC-0263, ASC-0264, ASC-0265, ASC-0266 harness contracts.
- scope: turn ASC-0260 planning slices into owner-bound child repo execution
  without implementing child code directly from MyWorld.
- dispatch:
  - `asc-0263` -> `claude@hivemind`
  - `asc-0264` -> `claude@memoryOS`
  - `asc-0265` -> `claude@CapabilityOS`
  - `asc-0266` -> `claude@GenesisOS`
- results:
  - Hivemind committed `7295e9e Add serving worker queue/resume with per-user isolation`.
  - MemoryOS committed `dd8acba Add serving memory lifecycle`.
  - CapabilityOS committed `12e7b38 ASC-0265: implement per-user serving access routing`.
  - GenesisOS committed `4670471 Add serving prelaunch adversarial challenge harness (ASC-0266)`.
- policy delta: `scripts/aios_action_policy.py` now allows only narrow
  owner-bound, human-approved child dispatch packets whose allowed files are
  entirely under the target repo, even when the contract discusses provider or
  credential boundaries. Cross-repo files, missing approval, paid/private
  transfer, public/legal authority, and irreversible actions still block.
- verification:
  - MyWorld action policy/dispatch tests passed 69/69.
  - `hivemind`: serving worker tests passed 28/28; py_compile and diff check passed.
  - `memoryOS`: serving memory tests passed 22/22; py_compile and diff check passed.
  - `CapabilityOS`: serving access tests passed 26/26; py_compile and diff check passed.
  - `GenesisOS`: serving prelaunch tests passed 16/16; py_compile and diff check passed.
- release gate delta: `ready_for_production_serving=false`, `met=5`,
  `partial=4`, `missing=0`. Hivemind, MemoryOS, CapabilityOS are now `met`;
  GenesisOS harness is present but launch proof remains missing by design.
- world readiness: remains `ready_for_world_deployment=false`.
- next: Product Design Slice 1 remains first blocker; observability/support
  redaction and serving UI/browser proofs still need owner-bound follow-up.

## 2026-06-14 Codex — Completed Serving Product Design Ideation

### What I Changed
- Added `docs/contracts/ASC-0268-serving-product-design-ideation.md`.
- Added `docs/product/AIOS_SERVING_DESIGN_BRIEF.md`.
- Preserved three generated options under `docs/product/assets/`.
- Updated the serving release gate to distinguish `needs_ideation` from
  `needs_selection`.

### Commands Run
- `python3 /home/user/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-curated-remote/product-design/0.1.46/skills/user-context/scripts/user_context_preflight.py` -> no saved Product Design context.
- Image Gen -> generated exactly three options: Task Cabin, Mission Control For
  One Job, Memory-First Service Desk.

### Notes For Other Agents
- No `apps/serving/**` implementation is allowed yet.
- `.aios/serving/design_gate.json` is local ignored state and now records
  `visual_target_type=needs_selection`, `build_allowed=false`.
- Next owner action: operator selects option 1, 2, or 3, or requests a revised
  hybrid before ASC-0253 UI prototype work starts.

## 2026-06-14 Codex — Completed Serving Design Target Selection CLI

### What I Changed
- Added ASC-0269 as the replayable selection contract.
- Extended `scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py` with `needs_selection` and
  `select`.
- Added tests proving selection requires user confirmation, known option ids,
  existing image files, and keeps build blocked until an option is selected.

### Commands Run
- `python3 -m unittest tests.test_aios_serving_design_gate -v` -> 14/14 passed.
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py` -> passed.
- `python3 scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py assess --root . --json` ->
  valid gate, `next_action=product_design_select_visual_target`.

### Notes For Other Agents
- The operator can now select an option with
  `python3 scripts/aios_serving_design_gate.py select --root . --option-id <id> --confirmed-by-user --write --json`.
- This command only updates the local ignored design gate. It still does not
  build `apps/serving/**`; ASC-0253 owns that follow-up.

## 2026-06-14 Codex — Starting AIOS Dream Expansion / Claude Hardening Split

### Planned work
- Preserve an aggressive AIOS dream/growth map as speculative evidence.
- Delegate system hardening to Claude through an accepted MyWorld contract.

### Files I expect to touch
- `docs/discoveries/2026-06-14-aios-dream-explosive-expansion.md`
- `docs/contracts/ASC-0270-aios-dream-expansion-claude-hardening.md`
- `docs/AGENT_WORKLOG.md`
- `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`

### Coordination note for other agents
- Codex owns product/growth/frontier framing here.
- Claude owns hardening, invariants, and contract pack critique.
- No `apps/**`, child repo, credential, or private-history file should be
  touched in this slice.

### Completion evidence
- External baseline checked: OpenAI Agents SDK/sandbox material, Anthropic MCP
  docs, and Google A2A docs.
- Verification passed: `test -f docs/discoveries/2026-06-14-aios-dream-explosive-expansion.md`.
- Verification passed: `python3 scripts/aios_serving_release_gate.py assess --root . --json`
  kept `ready_for_production_serving=false`.
- Verification passed: `python3 scripts/aios_world_readiness.py --json` kept
  `ready_for_world_deployment=false`.
- Verification passed: `git diff --check`.
- Next: commit/push the Codex dream slice, then retry Claude hardening dispatch.

## 2026-06-14 Codex — Gate A Infrastructure Fanout Drafted

### Goal
- Move the long-term AIOS infrastructure objective forward without waiting for
  serving UI visual target selection.
- Turn ASC-0271 Gate A into owner-bound proposed contracts that child OS agents
  can accept/release through the normal AIOS loop.

### Files Changed
- `docs/research/AIOS_AGENT_SERVICE_INFRA_DELTA_2026-06-14.md`
- `docs/contracts/ASC-0272-memoryos-dream-agora-intake.md`
- `docs/contracts/ASC-0273-capabilityos-credential-grants-and-blindspots.md`
- `docs/contracts/ASC-0274-smx-bounded-workspace-contract-split.md`
- `docs/contracts/ASC-0275-genesisos-entropy-quota-enforcement.md`
- `docs/contracts/ASC-0276-agent-company-studio-gate-a-framing.md`
- `docs/product/AIOS_AGENT_COMPANY_STUDIO_BRIEF.md`
- `docs/product/AIOS_SERVING_DESIGN_BRIEF.md`
- `docs/AIOS_AGENT_LEDGER.md`

### Evidence
- External official sources checked: OpenAI Agents SDK, Sandbox Agents,
  Agents observability, running agents/session state, Agent Builder, MCP docs,
  Anthropic MCP connector, Google A2A, and Google Interactions API/ADK/A2A.
- GenesisOS critic first flagged `assumption-silent`, `time-frozen`,
  `terminology-trapped`, and `single-frame`; the research delta was revised
  with assumptions/negations, 1h/1w/1y horizons, plain language, and a
  cross-domain frame. Final critic result: no prison signatures.
- Child repo worktrees checked clean before drafting contracts.
- No `apps/**` files changed.
- Contracts are `proposed` with `human_approved=false`; no child execution was
  claimed.

### Next
- Operator/delegated controller may accept and dispatch ASC-0272..ASC-0275 to
  Claude in the owning child repos.
- ASC-0276 remains docs-only until visual target selection opens Gate B.

## 2026-08-09 · memoryOS 소비자 리포트 (claude@prizehunter → claude@myworld)
- **핸드오프**: `docs/MEMORYOS_CONSUMER_REPORT_2026-08-09.md`
- prizehunter 가 `memoryos import/search` 를 실사용하고 왕복 검증(114 nodes/137 edges, rc=0).
- 요청 6건. 우선순위 ①**임베딩 0% 백필 + 한국어 모델 실측 선정**(nomic 실패·bge-m3 채택 근거 포함)
  ②**outcome 엣지(`refuted_by`/`confirmed_by`)** — 공급원(전이율표)이 이미 존재
  ③`healthy=0.0%` 원인 규명 ④검색 신뢰등급 ⑤`law` 타입+반증조건 ⑥프로그램 회수 인터페이스.
- 연결의 가치 실증: prizehunter 의 막힌 지점이 재원 온톨로지의 `GenesisOS`(ASC-0065)에 이미 매핑돼 있었다.

## 2026-08-10 · 아이디어 흡수 organ + 미래 목표 (claude@myworld)
- **지시**: *"what is the future goal of us"* + *"인터넷에 방대하게 흩어진 Ideation들을 흡수해서 자산화 해"*
- **목표 문서**: `docs/AIOS_FUTURE_GOAL_2026-08-10.md` — 목표 자체의 반증 조건 4개 포함.
  한 줄: *모델이 거절할 수 없는 행위(host 발화 · 외부 오라클 판정 · 거부 시 revert)를 OS의 기본 단위로.*
- **흡수 organ**: `scripts/aios_ideation.py` (`aios.ideation.v1`), 자산 `ideation/`.
  요약 문서가 아니라 **원장**: 각 행이 축자 근거 + 반증자 + 재명명 판정을 가진다.
  오라클은 결정적 코드이고 생성기(로컬 30B)를 통과시키지 않는다 — 패러프레이즈는 substring 검사에서 죽는다.
- **M0 연결**: 이 사이클이 최소동작 4항을 전부 요구하며 Channel-E `dispatch`가 아니므로
  Mortuary Clause와 무관. §3 판정 규칙을 `tests/test_ideation.py::test_receipt_satisfies_M0_judgment_rule`에
  실행 가능한 단언으로 고정(12 tests green).
- **실측 결함 3건**:
  ① qwen3 계열은 `format:json`에서도 답을 `thinking`으로 보내 `response`가 비어 옴 → 전 행 `empty_claim`.
     오라클이 내용이 아니라 **전송을 거부**하고 있었다. `think:false` + fallback.
  ② **ollama+bge-m3가 특정 입력에서 HTTP 500 `unsupported value: NaN`** (3/3 재현 = 결정적 결함).
     zero-vector 대체 + 건수 보고(코사인 0이라 가짜 중복은 못 만들고 novelty만 부풀림).
     ⚠ memoryOS 리랭크도 같은 임베더를 쓰면 동일 결함에 노출된다 — 별도 확인 필요.
  ③ `ledger_root(path=LEDGER)` 기본값이 import 시점 바인딩 → 원장 경로를 바꾸면 엉뚱한 파일을 해싱,
     `root_before == root_after`가 되어 M0 영수증이 조용히 무효화됨. 호출 시점 해석으로 수정.
- **정직한 미결**: 첫 캘리브레이션(문서 단위 임베딩 + 원문 문장 양성대조)은 **Youden J=0.52, separated=false** —
  우리 문장(0.58)과 무관 분야 초록(0.50)이 거의 안 갈렸다. granularity 불일치(문장↔문서)와
  잘못된 양성대조(표절 탐지지 재명명 탐지가 아님)를 고쳐 passage 단위 + 로컬 모델 패러프레이즈로 재측정 중.
  **재측정도 separated=false면 `rename` 판정은 근거 없음으로 표기한다.**
