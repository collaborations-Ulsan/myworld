# Changelog

All notable changes to AIOS (`aios-os`). Format: themed summaries per release.
Tag `vX.Y.Z` → `publish.yml` builds + publishes to PyPI.

## [Unreleased] — contributable for the first time (2026-08-10)

The repo was public but not actually open source, and the badge at the top of
the README was lying. Both fixed.

### Licence and contribution surface
- **Apache-2.0 `LICENSE` added.** The repo had no licence file at all, which
  means all rights reserved — nobody could legally contribute. `pyproject`
  separately declared MIT, so metadata and reality disagreed; both now say
  Apache-2.0. Nothing had been published to PyPI and there were no external
  contributors, so no one had relied on the MIT declaration.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue forms and a PR
  template. Includes a `negative_result` issue form — this project publishes
  its own nulls, so "I tried this and it didn't work" gets a front door.

### CI was red, and had been since 2026-08-03
- **Stale assertion.** `test_aios_provider_prompts` asserted the literal string
  `"AIOS Provider Contract"`, which the claude template stopped emitting when it
  was slimmed to a pointer in v2 (2026-07-11). The assertions now check durable
  properties — the block points at *this* install and carries the privacy
  invariant — instead of echoing template prose, which is what made it rot.
- **Test isolation.** `experiments/*/` ship modules with generic names
  (`tasks.py`, `schema.py`, …) and several experiments use the same ones.
  `sys.modules` is keyed on the bare name, so in a full-suite run
  `tests/test_driftbench_harness.py` was silently handed
  `experiments/learnos/tasks.py` and **34 assertions failed** — while running
  that file alone passed 49/49. New `tests/_experiment_imports.load_from()`
  claims the right directory explicitly and raises if a name resolves
  elsewhere. Full suite: **2558 passed, 0 failed**.

### Optional dependencies can no longer take the core down
- Optional third-party imports were guarded with `except ImportError`, which
  catches an *absent* package but not a *broken* one. Reproduced: `treequest`
  imports jax, a jax/ml_dtypes version conflict raises `ValueError` at import
  time, and that aborted collection of the entire test suite. CI never saw it
  because on a clean runner the package is simply missing. Guards for
  `treequest`, `openai`, `mcp`, `torch`, `scrapling`, `keyring` and the QLoRA
  stack now catch `Exception` and degrade to unavailable.
- New `tests/test_optional_dependency_guards.py` fails the build if a
  third-party optional import is guarded by `ImportError` alone.

### Nothing personal ships to users any more
- The claude provider template hardcoded the author's absolute home path and
  the author's own list of private directory names, and `aios ... bootstrap`
  wrote that into every user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The path is now
  substituted per machine (`{{root}}`) and the privacy clause is generic, with
  a test that fails if anything personal reappears in a shipped template.
  Prompt version `asc-0087.v2` → `asc-0087.v3`.

## [0.2.0] — OSS-release addendum (2026-07-01)

The open-source readiness pass — one identity, a real installable package, and a
first run that shows the product.

### Identity — one sentence everywhere
- README, `docs/AIOS_NORTHSTAR.md`, the CLI banner, and the package description now
  lead with the same memory-led identity: *"a local-first memory layer for AI agents:
  learns from every run so your agents carry forward what worked, not start from zero."*
  Cross-agent network effects are framed as the explicit longer-term vision, not a
  present-tense claim.

### Packaging — plain `pip install .` now actually works
- The wheel previously shipped a single file (`aios_launcher.py`) and resolved every
  script from the repo clone — a non-editable install was broken. It now ships the
  35-module stdlib-only core (+ `aios_primitives` package); the launcher self-roots
  in site-packages (`resolve_root` "packaged" mode + `script_path()` fallback).
- Packaged installs never write state into the venv: launcher state and provenance
  receipts (`aios demo`) go to `AIOS_HOME` (default `~/.aios`).
- Commands outside the shipped core fail with a clean one-line "requires a full
  AIOS checkout" message instead of a traceback.
- Verified end-to-end: fresh venv, non-repo cwd — `aios --help`, `aios demo`,
  `aios behavior status` all exit 0; plain clone (no submodules) + `pip install .` works.

### First run — the demo now shows the headline
- `aios demo` leads with a MEMORY ACT on an isolated temp ledger: Run 1 on an empty
  ledger ("starting from zero") → the run is recorded through the real
  ingest→ledger pipeline → Run 2 answers the same question grounded in that recording
  (offline keyword/frequency fallback — no GPU, no key, no network). The verify-first
  copilot demo closes ("AI proposes, code verifies").

### Honesty & hygiene
- Removed the dead PyPI badge (package not yet published); re-add when it is.
- `pytest tests/` is green from a clean clone (research-probe fixtures under
  `tests/hivemind_tasks/` excluded from default collection).
- `aios behavior contribute` prints a consent notice: contributions are public +
  pseudonymous, tool-name metadata only.
- README documents module availability honestly (public core is self-contained;
  memoryOS/CapabilityOS/GenesisOS are private research repos, opened progressively).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-24

The "one foundation" release: a research-backed reliability core, two unifying
spines, a real brand + CLI, and the seeds of parameter-level self-improvement.
~147 commits since 0.1.0.

### Reliability — research-backed turn-loop (arXiv 2509.09677 / 2604.11978)
- Self-conditioning defense: old error traces compressed so the model doesn't
  err more after seeing its own mistakes.
- Horizon-aware routing: long/multi-step tasks → reasoning model (qwen3:30b-a3b),
  short tasks → fast model.
- Execution-time plan verify+repair: stall → forced re-plan (process-level failures
  are 72.5%).
- Long-range constraint re-surfacing from MemoryOS during a run.

### Architecture — condensation to one foundation
- One capability spine (`aios_routing`): classify_horizon / select_model_by_horizon /
  classify_domain / executable_clis — one routing brain.
- One memory spine (`aios_memory`): retrieve / memoryos_context (single MemoryOS call)
  / contribute_run (single ledger write) + sparse domain activation at runtime.
- Runner unification: the 4 pillars apply on both head and harness paths; shared
  render_directives + decondition_history in the kernel turn-loop.

### Onboarding & absorption
- `aios onboard`: one-shot absorb (device LLMs + agent CLIs) → classify usable →
  e2e verify → manifest; CLI + MCP tool. Surfaces hippocampal-capture status.
- Absorb→use closed: grok adapter; onboard derives executable providers from the
  adapter registry. Capability scan runs at install.

### Brand, marker & CLI design
- Brand identity (Cosmic Ledger) + presence sigil `✦` / marker `✦ aios`
  (`aios_sigil`), single source.
- CLI design system (`aios_cli_style`) applied to real terminal output.
- `aios cli` — interactive runtime shell (`✦ aios ›`).
- Ambient presence: every AIOS-wired session opens with `✦ AIOS active`.
- Tightened CLI surface (grouped help), graceful `serve` port-in-use, `discover`
  default root, silent-no-op fix (provider fallback).

### Self-improving (CLS) — foundations
- CLS architecture plan (`docs/AIOS_SELF_IMPROVING.md`): hippocampus + dream +
  (frontier) neocortical fine-tune.
- Sub-agent / sidechain recognition + provider-feature capture in session ingest.
- Domain tools (FinanceMind/HRMind/LogisticsMind/…) wired into routing.

### Fixed
- Numerous robustness fixes surfaced by per-command verification (env-artifact vs
  code-regression isolation). Full suite green: 1258 passed.

## [0.1.0]
- Initial AIOS: kernel head, 5-OS organs, AkashicRecord ledger, behavior predict,
  install.sh, Docker, PyPI packaging.
